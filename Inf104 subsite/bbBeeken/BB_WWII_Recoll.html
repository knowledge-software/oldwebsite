Much of it was repressed over theintervening years; I had not wanted to talk about it. But, howevertraumatic the experience probably was at the time, some fifty oddyears has now ameliorated that feeling to a considerable extent.Recently I have been doing a great deal of reading about this worldwide conflict. Many excellent accounts and commentaries have recentlybeen published, probably purposefully, to coincide with the fiftiethanniversary of its ending. My purpose, in so doing, is to determinewhere my infinitessably small part fitted into the totality andperhaps derive some meaning from the experience. The summing,(integrating), of all the infinitesimals, is what brought about theeventual outcome of this confligration.</p><p>My tale shall begin in the fall of 1941, when I was enrolled inthe music conservatory at Oberlin College as a freshman majoring invoice, for which I had been awarded a scholarship. The memorablemoment was, of course, that Sunday in December when I had come backfrom my choir job in Cleveland and heard over the radio the news ofthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I don't think I realized thenhow irreparably altered my future would be.</p><p>During the coming year Lewis, my younger brother, was called upand he opted for the ASTP(the Army Specialized Training Program).Jack, my older brother had already been in the Army Air Corps twoyears and had decided on a career in the military. That left me thesole male in the family at home and exempt from being drafted for thetime being. At the time I felt a bit guilty about this. During thesummer I worked in a machine tool factory engaged in the fabricationof various tank parts. I made a good buck working overtime at millingmachines turning out bushings for tank treads.</p><p>By the time I arrived back on campus, I had decided that theconcentration on music alone was too intellectually confining andaltered my status to a physics major with a music minor. I was alsoattracted by the idea of continuing my education in the ASTP ( ArmySpecialized Training Program) so I enlisted in the reserves early inthe first term. This also assuaged somewhat my guilt about my draftstatus.</p><p>Near the end of the spring semester I recieved orders to report toan army base near Covington Ky.. There I was duly processed andshipped to Camp Wolters,Texas for two months of basic militarytraining. From whence I was sent to Lehigh University, three months,then to Rutgers University, three months, the subject under studybeing advanced electrical engineering. At the end of the semester atRutgers the downsizing of the ASTP began. I surmised that more cannonfodder was needed than brains. I found myself on the way to joiningthe 104th Infantry as a rifleman at Camp Carson Colorado.</p><p>There those of us from the ASTP program were labeled 'quiz kids'and underwent an intensive and arduous four months of training in themartial arts and infantry tactics as applied in modern warfare. Thequiz kids were not expected to stand the gaff and become real footsoldiers (Too brainy, don't you know), and as a cosequence wereridden hard. We not only weathered the rigors of the training, butalso, within a month, or so, of the 104th's entry into combat, thequiz kids were running the outfit, by promotions through the Noncomlevels and battle field commissions. Apparently having brains, as alowly foot slogging infantry man, was not necessarily a detriment.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll1"></a>Recollection 1: The Voyage, pps 37-38</h3><p>The 104th Infantry Division received orders to transfer to CampKilmer New Jersey from Camp Carson in mid August. It appeared asthough our intensive training with the division was about to be putto the test and that our participation in the war would take place inthe ETO (European Theater of Operations). After three boring days inthe crammed coaches of the train in which we were packed, we arrivedat Camp Kilmer in New Jersey where processing for shipment overseasbegan. It was a four or five day procedure, and I managed to wranglea half day pass to New York City somewhere in that time. I saw a bitof the citadel for the first time and shacked up with an Oberlinsweetheart. I just barely managed to make it back before roll callthe following morning.</p><p>After many a 'hurry up and wait' and the final issue of battlegear, we finally were loaded on to busses and were driven to New YorkHarbor. On the ride in I was actually a little excited at theprospect of a voyage on the high seas, the submarine threatnotwithstanding. At the harbor pier we plodded up the gang plank intoa ship christened the 'Cristobal'. The USAT <cite>'Cristobal'</cite>was a prewar Caribbean vacation cruise ship and was not very large.As a consequence, she did not ride particularly smooth in the roughseas of the first few days.</p><p>Attempting to make myself comfortable in a hammock of theextremely crowded and odiferous hold of the ship was more than Icould manage. I found it much more to my liking up on deck, andhunkered down with my bed gear on one of the open but roofed overafterdecks. Also, as luck would have it, the ship's library was justinside and, in which, I found a compendium of Joseph Conrad novelsand Tolstoy's War and Peace. The latter seemed quite appropriate inview of the coming experience. Between long chow lines, sleep,drills, calisthenics, and training sessions, I devoured these gems.In my reflective moments about our destination, the question of whatmy behavior might be in a combat situation didn't come up very oftenor trouble me very much as I recall. Though I had seen the great warfilm "All Quiet on the Western Front," had done some reading andexperienced the simulated combat conditions in training, they would,in fact, turn out to be quite tame compared to the reality. 'Maybe itwill be all over before we get there. Huh? Maybe?'</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll2"></a>Recollection 2: Utah Beach, pg. 39.</h3><p>It was about dusk when the ship anchored off shore. From over theside we loaded into LCM's.(Landing Craft Medium) It was drizzling.The occasion had a very somber aspect to it. The LCM grounded about100 ft. from the beach. We waded in from the craft, three feet ofwater at the start. It was very quiet, nobody talked.` As we trudgedup the embankment, my thoughts turned to WWI and General Pershing'sdeclaration, "Lafayette we are here". On the other side of the bluffwe loaded into trucks and off we went to our bivouac area. My firstsight of badly damaged towns, at least what could be seen in the dimlight, was sobering. Revealed at dawn, the apple orchard in which weset up our pup tents turned out to be quite charming.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll3"></a>Recollection 3: Red Ball Express, pps41-43.</h3><p>The division was given the assignment, among others, of organizingtruck companies for the purpose of speeding needed supplies to theBritish and American Army units, which were, at this time, rapidlymoving across France toward Germany and dogging the heals of theretreating Wehrmacht. To the 415th Regiment was delegated theresponsibility of guarding vital army installations, such astransport and storage facilities, to forestall looting and possiblesabotage. The mission for G Co. was to guard the rails. Being a Pfc.,I was put in charge of a detail of six men, (mere Pvt.'s), to rideshot gun on freight trains running to Paris from the Cherberg area.The trip took two or three days. We made two trips. The rate at whichwe moved depended on the condition of the rails, and the cautioustraverse through heavily bombed areas. The pace was never very brisk.</p><p>The duties consisted, mainly, of patrolling up and down the trainwhen it was at a standstill. We remained in the caboose when moving.We encountered no saboteurs, looters, nor enemy attempts to wreck thetrain as was thought possible.The stay over in Paris beforereturning, unfortunately, was very short; over night at most. We wereconfined to the rail yard area by MP's. However, I almost had anaffair with a French girl on the second train. We allowed some Frenchcivilian hitchhikers aboard on the way in to Paris, among whom wasthe girl. In spite of the her drab attire, which was understandableconsidering the conditions in northern France at the time, she wasnot unattractive. There was not enough privacy to bring things tofruition, but she gave me her address in Paris. However, I was unableto get past the MPs at the yards so I flunked out there.</p><p>Then came the inevitable, the directive to move to the front. Thedivision was attached to the British 2nd Corps and we were to relieveand or reinforce certain British units in Belgium and Holland. Thisassignment was no doubt engineered by our intrepid divisioncommander, General Terry Allen, who desired nothing more than todemonstrate his ability to handle an Infantry Division in directcombat with the enemy. This talent had been amply and convincinglydemonstrated in his command of the 1st Division, (The Big Red), inNorth Africa and Sicily under General Patton. From what I recentlyread in a biography of General Patton, I gather they had a fallingapart and General Allen returned stateside to train a new division.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll4"></a>Recollection 4: Belgium, pps 43-48.</h3><p>The trip by truck from Normandy was long and arduous. We literallydisgorged from the trucks into a large flat open area near a pineforest. Here we bivouacked and spent the next two days tooling up inpreparation for 'combat duty', as it was designated.</p><p>During the day we were treated to aerial combat scenes betweenP-40s, P-47s and enemy aircraft. We also were able to see buzz bombsflying to the north east and the maneuvers made by the P-47s to shootthem down. The biggest show was the appearance of the new German jetfighter-bomber and the futile attempts by the P-40's to shoot itdown. It was no contest; the jet was far too fast. This display was adisquieting reminder of a fact we already knew, that we soon would befacing some weaponry superior to our own.</p><p>A day or two later we marched out to relieve some Canadian Unitsnorthwest of Wuerstwexel, whereupon we dug in next to an artillerybattery. The sound of gunfire from now on would be a constantaccompaniment. Distinguishing between friendly and enemy fire wouldbecome important, as we later came to learn.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll5"></a>Recollection 5: Holland, pps 61-95.</h3><p>A day or so later we made a rather wearisome approach march,following F Company (F Co.). to Audenbosch, where we had our firstsignificant encounter with the Werhmacht. Occupying the townnecessitated eliminating pockets of sniper and harassing fire. Whatamazed me at this point was the behavior of the inhabitants. In spiteof the high explosives and gunfire a, block or so back down thestreet, they were out sweeping up battle debris in front of theirrespective dwellings just behind us. F Co. was evolved in the firefight ahead of us.</p><p>When we finally reached the other end of town it was getting dark.Our company, G Co., fanned out to the left front to establishdefensive positions against possible counter attacks. Our platoonSargent was about to assign me my foxhole location when all hellbroke loose, or so it seemed. The screaming whine of incoming andblasting '88' artillery shells had me hugging the ground in no timeflat, shovel off my pack and digging. Fortunately, I was in a furrowso I initially had some protection from the shrapnel flying around.Never the less, that was the quickest I ever dug a fox hole on mybelly that I can recall. It was the first sustained period of frightof my combat experience. Though it seemed forever at the time, thebarrage let up in about an hour or so. Throughout the night and thenext day, subsequent barrages were shorter and sporadic. One did notdare stray too far from one's foxhole. There were of course quite afew casualties.</p><p>Dawn revealed the nature of our position. We had dug into the edgeof a very large beet field with the town we had taken immediately toour right rear. To the right was a road with a few stray buildingsalong it, badly damaged. The area around us was, also, heavily pockmarked with shell holes. I was surprised and a little uneasy at thenumber of unexploded shells sticking up out of the ground. After halfa day and they hadn't detonated we concluded they were duds. It wasthought that perhaps they might have been armed with delayed actionfuses. (We wondered who was working for us on the assembly line forthose shells in Germany.) We had an excellent field of fire over aflat area 500 yards, or so, to the distant buildings at our front. Soduring the day, between barrages ,we improved on our emplacement.Since the sky was overcast and rain likely, I commandeered a doorfrom one of the ruins, near by, and roofed over my, by then, morespacious quarters. I further shoveled another foot of earth on top ofthe door. And, oh yes, I also found a small rug to lay on the floor.As an added touch, a little fire place at the back of the foxhole wasconstructed for my can of Sterno to warm up cans of C Rations. I wasquite willing and prepared to wait out the rest of the war rightthere.</p><p>I had not, as yet, an occasion to fire my trusty M1, (Rifle).Peering with the naked eye over the rim at the entrance to myfoxhole, toward the distant buildings to our front, hardly provided aclearly visible target. I didn't have a sniper's rifle with a scope.We were sure that there had to be an artillery spotter thereinsomewhere, directing fire on us and others. During the second daythere appeared to be a duel between our artillery and theirs. We musthave won, because by the end of the second day, shelling in oursector had ceased.The next day we were again on an approach march torenew the attack on the Werhmacht in our assigned sector. It wasraining, and already, I was missing my little home away from home.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll6"></a>Recollection 6: The Mark River, pps 75-87.</h3><p>We came up just short of the Mark river,where sporadic shellinghad us digging in again, this time in the rain and muck. Our platoonwas positioned in a cabbage field. It was impossible to go more thana foot or so deep before one came to water. No elaborate foxholesthis time. They were little more than very soggy slit trenches. Theview from them, through the cabbage heads in the mist and the rain,was a bit eerie. It was a miserable situation and very depressing.</p><p>The next day, or so, we were subjected to the noise of whatsounded like a fierce battle at the river to our right front. Beingsituated back where we were, nothing much could be seen. We laterlearned that elements of the the 1st Battalion had crossed the riverat dawn in boats, after a perfunctory artillery bombardment ofsupposed enemy positions. Having gotten across into flat area betweenthe river and the fifty foot high dike running roughly parallel tothe river in that region, they were savagely attacked, (effectivelyambushed), by German armored and infantry units. They sufferedconsiderable casualties and were forced to withdraw whatever theycould back across the river. All of which took considerable doing.See pg. 79 of "Tracks". This action seemed like a case of overconfidence and, or, a real tactical blunder; a little of bothprobably. Anyway, it was obvious that the intent of German commandwas to hold the line at the Mark river. The drive to the Maas riverfrom this point was not going to be easy.</p><p>The plan, now, was a renewed attack on a much broader front afterconcentrated and protracted artillery barrages. F Co. to our left andwe, G Co., at midnight, moved up to the boats placed near to theriver's edge earlier by Army engineers. They provided a pilot foreach craft. The solid roar of the artillery air and ground burstsjust across the river, was deafening and awe inspiring. (The questionin my mind was how could any living thing survive under such fire?).In any event it was reassuring. Our chances of survival on the otherside of the river seemed to improve with every shell burst.</p><p>When the barrage ceased we shouldered the boats, trudged to theshore,launched and rowed across the river. Since it wasn't more than75 feet wide, we beached on the other side in short order, scrambledout of the boats and up the river bank. Because of the overcastskies, it was so dark one could barely make out a hand in front ofone's face. I felt some trepidation during the crossing and thelanding; but the adrenalin was more up up than the fear. At least itseemed so to me.</p><p>There was some machine gun fire off to our left immediately afterwe landed; but the sound of two grenades exploding in quicksuccession and some rifle fire ended that. Furtively, working our wayup the incline, we came to a couple of burning buildings They weren'traging fires as of yet, but they provided some light. As we passedthe buildings to the road on top of the dike, grenades were tossedinto likely spots, such as bunkers, doors and windows. Soon shouts of"Kamarad" were heard and a goodly number of the enemy appeared, withtheir hands up, out of cellars and bunkers. They were rounded up andescorted back down to the river. Some of them looked rather shakenup, a condition commonly referred to as shell-shock.</p><p>When I finally arrived back up on the dike road, I found a largegroup of the company huddled against a burned out German tank. Thereseemed to be some confusion as to what was to be done next. I beganto feel considerable trepidation as I went among them looking formembers of my squad. This behavior violated the cardinal rule tonever bunch up in an attack. A few mortar shells well placed wouldhave been disastrous. A lieutenant and a platoon Sargent showed upand scattered us along the river side of the dike. As dawn broke, GCo. formed up into its three platoons. With our platoon, the 3rd., inthe lead, we began our new assignment; which was to sweep out any ofthe enemy remaining in the area between the dike and the riverupstream.</p><p>We moved forward in the usual approach march formation, twocolumns well apart and spaced out. Our squad headed the column on theright, the river side. I was the third in line after the point man.Initially, there was no enemy fire of any kind as we moved throughthe area. While we advanced, it was comforting to hear the freighttrains overhead. ( The sound of heavy artillery shells passing overinto enemy positions on the other side of the dike).</p><p>A gruesome sight greeted us when we came upon the area, wherepreviously, units of the 1st Battalion had been battered. Quite a fewbodies were strewn about in various attitudes. The scene wasunsettling to say the least. They had been subjected to direct firefrom enemy tanks up on the dike road above. Fox-holes were noprotection, as was evident from the bodies blown half in and out. Andwe thought we had it bad in our baptism of fire back at Oudenbosch?As far as I could see there was no comparison.</p><p>Somewhat sobered by this, we moved on. We were directed to a smallmesa abutting the dike. On it adjacent to the road was a farmbuilding with trees around it. As we came up to the bottom of theslope, from near the top, a panzerfaust was fired at us. It detonatedin front of the point man. We hit the ground and, as what became ahabit with me, I went down with my rifle in a firing position. Anenemy soldier jumped up from where he had launched the missile andbegan running to the farmhouse. I squeezed off two shots and hedropped to the ground and laid motionless. For some reason, I was theonly one to fire his weapon. Later, while a small detachment was upmaking sure the house was clear of the enemy, the Captain wanted toknow who fired and shot the Jerry. I owned up to the fact, somewhatfearful that I done the wrong thing, that he wanted instead, aprisoner for interrogation. When I asked, "Shouldn't I have?". Hisreply was, "You did fine. Its comforting to know I have at least oneman in the company who is alert and aggressive." I was informed byone of the members of the house search detachment that the 'kraut' Ifelled had two bullet holes in his chest and was quite dead. I reallydidn't want to hear about it. But at the same time, remembering thescene we recently passed through, I didn't feel too badly abouthaving killed that particular human being. ('After all isn't this apart of what war is all about?')</p><p>We moved on toward the end of the area where the river turned inclose to the dike and another farm stead with trees about it. Atabout 400 yards out, we encountered canon and machine gun fire from,what appeared to be, a medium tank or armored vehicle. Since it wasfairly well masked by the house and trees, it was difficult to makean accurate determination without binoculars. We of course hit theground. The firing was of short duration; nobody was hit. They musthave been lousy marksmen. After a short wait, the three of us on thepoint bolted back to to the low ridge behind us; where we found therest of the company digging in along the ridge running from the diketo the river. Since night would soon be upon us, it was decided toremain there for the night. "Discretion before valor", as they say.As soon as I had dug my foxhole and eaten a ration. I went to sleep.I was exhausted. The past eighteen hours or so of wide awake activityhad probably been sustained by a high adrenalin level.</p><p>In the morning I was awakened by my squad leader, Sargent Lowe. Iwas apparently a 'you, you and you volunteer' for patrol duty. Ourmission was to seek and make contact with F Co., supposedly,somewhere on our left rear flank. The Captain was unable to 'raise'them on his 'walky-talky'. We got over the dike and down on to thelow land on the other side without incident. We proceeded north eastkeeping as low as possible. Standaarbuiten a several kilometers toour left could be seen undergoing heavy bombardment. We hadn't gonemore than a mile or so, when we were subjected to small arms fire. Asthe snap of bullets going by increased, a mortar exploded to our leftrear, then one to our front. We were being zeroed in for a mortarbarrage. Sgt. Lowe, who was leading us, pivoted and shouted, "Letsget the fuck out of here!" No difficulty following that order.</p><p>So back we scrambled, zigzagging as we ran. And none too soon asthe as the spot we vacated erupted with mortar bursts. That mortarcrew knew its business. When we returned to the company area, I wentwith Sgt. Lowe to report to the Captain. I was curious to know why wehadn't called for artillery or mortar fire on the enemy strong pointin front of us and holding up our advance. Evidently, there were toomany much higher priority targets for the artillery to bother withour little fracas. Also, we did not have a mortar squad attached tous and none was available at the at the moment. I went back to myfoxhole and slept some more.</p><p>Late that afternoon I was again designated for a patrol to takeplace after dark. The mission was to sneak up close to the farmstead, making our way along the river bank. This maneuver was tobring us close to the rear of the buildings, and reveal the nature ofthe opposing force there. Sgt. Lowe was given a 'walky-talky' overwhich to report whatever we could discern about the disposition ofweapons and personnel. It was well after dark when we started out.About midway to our destination our movement must have been detected.A dozen or so 88's came in and across the river close by. Needless tosay we hit the soggy bank and laid there for a time.</p><p>After a while, when it seemed the volley was the extent of theenemy effort to 'wipe us out', as Sgt. Lowe put it, we went on,crouching to keep as low a profile as possible. Eventually, we cameto a 5 or 6 foot wide drainage channel feeding out from the vicinityof the farm to the river. We crept along the edge of that toward thefarm for about 100 yards where we encountered thick high underbrush.There we stopped, and Sgt. Lowe ordered us to dig in. Whereupon,wedid so, shoveling as quietly as possible and awaited daylight.</p><p>Dawn came and revealed the farm stead only about 75 yards away.Through a gap in the the brush and the small trees, I could see thesecond story windows of the house and a portion of the roof of theattached barns. I was certain Sgt. Lowe couldn't see any more than Icould. I Kept my eye on those two windows in case a sniper or machinegunner showed. There we were all by our lonesome, the piddling fourof us, facing the enemy far too close for comfort. To say the least Iwas a bit uneasy. What the hell do we do now? At the most, we couldonly remain hunkered down until dark, hope that we wouldn't bespotted, and return to the ridge the way we came.</p><p>About mid morning, Sgt. Lowe crawled over to my foxhole andinformed me that he had arranged, over the 'walky-talky' for machinegun and rifle fire over our heads into the farm commencing in 10minutes, and that we were to run like hell straight over the flatback to the ridge. "Jesus Christ!!#^**!" I muttered to myself, as Iwormed over to the other two to relay the message. When the firingbegan, we scampered at top speed back to the ridge. The canon of thearmored vehicle fired several rounds at us. Being buttoned up, thegunner's visibility probably wasn't very good. The shots were wide oftheir mark. One of them plopped into the ground ten feet or so to myright front, but didn't explode. Either, it was a dud or just anarmor piercing shell. If it had been a fragmentation shell, I wouldnot be here to tell this tale. To say that my heart was in my mouthduring that sprint, would be putting it mildly.</p><p>When I returned to my foxhole, I got in and promptly went tosleep. I was awakened later by the sound of mortars being fired.Looking at the farm stead I saw it bracketed by two explosions, apause, then more dead on. The place erupted in flames, and I suspectthe armored vehicle, what ever it was, hot footed it out of there.While awaiting orders to move out, I learned that our companycommander, Capt. Craig had been killed by a sniper's bullet, as hewas directing mortar fire on the farm. One of the platoon leaders, Ithink it was 1st Lieutenant Millinor, took over command of thecompany. He later attained the rank of Captain and lost his life inthe drive to the Roer river.</p><p>Subsequently, a jeep, with some big brass in it, pulled abreast tous up on the dike road as though there were no war going around us atall. It turns out that this little fracas of ours had long since beenby passed by the rest of the division. We were considerably behindthe front lines as they now existed. Needless to say we moved out,with alacrity, down the dike road, past the burning farm stead. As weproceeded toward the Maas river, we came upon an extensive andawesome scene of smashed burnt out enemy tanks, armored vehicles, andmany dead bodies of enemy infantry strewn about on the side of ahill. Evidently, an enemy counter attack had been subjected tomurderous artillery, antitank fire, and possibly aircraft attacks.That even- ing, somewhere near the river, we billeted in a smallvillage.</p><p>The next day, rumor had it that we were slated to go back to arest camp. We trek- ked a bit to rejoin our battalion, where upon, weboarded trucks. After about a three or four hour drive we arrived atan encampment where we had two days of bathing (hot showers), hotchow, mail, catching up on correspondence, and of course sleep. Maybea weeks leave to Paris would be next, 'huh, maybe?' That dream wasquashed, on the third day, with the news of our assignment to theFirst Army and a new combat mission at the Aachen front.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll7"></a>Recollection 7: The Aachen Front, pps107-110.</h3><p>It was another long grueling ride. We bivouacked in the rain, justsouth of Aachen, in sight of dragon teeth tank barriers and the firstline of battered pill boxes of the famed Siegfried Line. The next daywe went through and relieved elements of the First Division at theirfront. The H&uuml;rtgen forest region was hilly with large tracts ofpine timber trees interspersed with grassy meadows here and there.Pill boxes were situated at critical terrain features to provide anoptimum field of fire against attacking forces. The sector assignedto G Co. consisted of two large pill boxes, One reasonably intact,which served as the Company headquarters, the other, on top of thehill badly beaten up, with a burned out Sherman tank along side ofit. The latter two were exposed to direct enemy fire. Down a bit fromthe hilltop was a line of foxholes to which individually each of uswas assigned. It was nice to not have to dig again. On the highground at the edge of the pine tract and to the right of the companysector, was a well camouflaged out post that had to be manned 24hours a day. It was no more than an oversized foxhole with a crudeblind. There was, also, an outpost in the wreck of a pill box on thehilltop, manned only at night.</p><p>With one attack called off we remained in place for five days orso. Except for an occasional mortar round, (just out of pureorneriness I suppose), things were pretty quiet. One round landed ontop of the intact pill box, in which at the time, I was cleaning myrifle. I nearly jumped out of my skin. The blast reverberatedthroughout the confines of the structure which seemed to amplify theeffect. Being in one of these things under heavy fire couldn't havebeen much fun.</p><p>Aside from from turns at the outposts, there was not much to do.The duty tours at the outposts consisted of a four hour stretch witha buddy in the blind at the edge of the woods, and overnight with sixbuddies and a two hour watch stretch in the wreck of a pill box atthe top of the hill. Time hung heavily in our wait for the next majorattack on the Werhmacht. We tried not to think about it. Hot chow wasbrought to us only in the evening, after dark. Otherwise we subsistedon K and C Rations. To relieve the boredom I began to smoke thecigarettes from the little packet in the K Ration. My foxhole, myhome away from home, provided me with ample time for contemplation.In one of these musings, I decided that when I returned to schoolafter the war I would concentrate on physics as my major rather thanmusic, provided of course that I survived in one piece.</p><p>On the day of the big push, in the early morning, we were treatedto the sight of flight after flight of bombers overhead going fortargets inside enemy territory. Later the area resounded with theroar of preparatory artillery barrages on both sides of our front. Inour sector it seemed rather light; probably, because there were noclearly discernible targets in the forest, I reasoned. Notwithstanding, we moved out on the attack at H hour, past the wreckedpill box and tank, down the slope on the other side of the hill toanother large timber tract. Before starting, I had volunteered to bethe point man, but not because I was a brave idiot. I had made theobservation that when shelling was called in on an advancing column,it was always behind the point man. I reasoned that my chances ofsurvival in the ensuing the small arms fire was much greater than inthe shell fire. The very thought of the latter struck terror to myheart. The initial small arms fire is quite often inaccurate due tonervousness in the first moments of combat.</p><p>We encountered no enemy fire as we entered the woods. I came uponGerman helmet on the ground and, feeling angry, gave it a hard solidkick. I was made to realize later by Dean Svec that it was a stupidthing to do. If it had been mined I would have been a dead GI duck orseverely maimed, the thing I most feared, not death. Weaving throughthe underbrush I arrived eventually at the other edge of the woods.Here I paused and looked down and across a good sized meadow slopingto another pine timber tract. I didn't like the looks of it, but whatthe hell else could I do with the company pressing behind me?Muttering to myself, "You volunteered for this job stupid!", I lit acigarette and sauntered out into the meadow. The Krauts observingthis seeming nonchalant behavior must have reacted with amusedwonder. (" Was ein dumbkopf diese ist?") Out about 50 yards or so, Iglanced back and saw the lead men of of the company's four columns(the two Platoons committed to the attack) coming out of woods. Atthat moment a couple of machine guns opened fire from somewhere atthe bottom of the slope. With bullets overhead and about me I doveinto a near by shell hole. I remained hunched down there until thefiring had ceased, and wondered when the shelling would commence.Since nothing was happening after a half hour or so, I cautiouslypeered over the rim of the shell hole. I could not see a damned thingthrough the tall grass. However, there was a good sized tree stump afew feet forward and to the right of the shell hole. So I crawled outto the stump to attempt a look at a little higher elevation. Mymovement must have been observed because I soon heard the snap ofsnipers bullets over and about me. I immediately scrambled back tothe shell hole and began to wonder where the hell the company was.There hadn't been any return fire from their quarter.</p><p>After another hour or so and no shelling, feeling a bit lonelyand, certainly, no longer desirous of fighting the Werhmacht on myown, I decided I had better get the hell out of the pasture and backto the company, wherever they might be. 'Had I been abandoned to wagethe war all by myself?' I didn't crawl, I literally wormed my wayback to where I had come out of the woods. When I was finally wellinto the trees, I stood up and, "Glory be!", there was the wholecompany digging foxholes in defensive positions. Only one man hadbeen wounded but not seriously.</p><p>I reported to the company commander who seemed glad that I hadn'tbeen cut down, as he put it, and was able to make it back to thecompany. It was then I learned that the company's mission was only tomake contact with the enemy, establish a position to threaten theirsector and keep them committed in front of us. I returned to myplatoon and the Sargent assigned me a spot for my foxhole. In view ofthe growth towering above us, it was deemed advisable to build athick roof out of branches and earth for protection against shrapnelthat would probably rain down from tree bursts.</p><p>It was dark when I settled in. Not being assigned watch duty thatnight, I warmed a can of C Ration ate it and promptly went to sleep.I was awakened somewhat later by a barrage of artillery 88's in oursector. The area was being swept by their fire. I laid thereapprehensively listening as the shell bursts, successively, camenearer, one close by, then receding. Breathing a sigh of relief atthe latter I went back to sleep. Another similar bombardment occurredagain before dawn. I surmised that Jerry was a little nervous that,perhaps, we were going to launch one of our 'notorious' nightattacks.</p><p>In the morning the damage was assessed as follows: the forestfloor littered with branches and tree tops, a few men with nonserious shrapnel wounds, one killed by a direct hit on his foxhole,not at all a pretty sight and a bit unerving you might say. Duringthe day a light wet snow fell. In the afternoon I spent time at aforward observation post. An attempt was made to zero in some mortarrounds on a well camouflaged pill box whose approximate position atthe edge of the pine tract below the meadow had been determined. DeanSvec, a friend of mine, earlier in the day had been on a patrol,which by sneaking down through the woods on our right front, had comein sight of the pill box. He described, for the sake of a littlelevity, the sight of Krauts pissing and shitting in the open airlatrine at the side of the bunker. ('War or no war there areobligations which must be met').</p><p>The next morning , a dreary overcast day, orders were issued toadvance again. After a brief shelling of the bunker area by ourartillery, we moved out. I was the third man in our column,Carrothers and Taylor were ahead of me. Just as the three of us hadcleared the edge of the woods, a panzerfaust exploded immediately infront of Carrothers and a hail of machine gun and small arms fireswept over and around us. I dove into the nearest shell hole.Shortly, Taylor crawled up to me under the incessant fire and saidCarrothers was hit bad and lying in an exposed position. "Help medrag him back" he pleaded and crawled away. I hesitated for a moment,but just as quickly realized I had no choice in the matter andcrawled after him. Being scared was putting it mildly. In fact thefear was so strong I hardly knew what the hell I was doing as we, onour bellies, dragged Carrothers back into and under the few treesthere. Then hurriedly lugged him further back into a small clearingout of the line of fire. Carrothers whole forehead was laid open andwas bleeding from other wounds lower down. He was semi-conscious kepttrying to get to his feet. I told Taylor to go get a medic and astretcher while I remained and held him down. Almost immediatelyafter he left, the area erupted with mortar bursts. We wereapparently smack dab in the center of a target area for a Jerrymortar battery. There was no way I could start digging. I laid halfover Carrothers who was still attempting get up. As the barragecontinued and I was on the verge of panic, an explosion took place onwhat I thought was my right leg, since it kicked so hard. I thoughtto myself, "Uh oh, there goes a leg!" Ten minutes or so later thebarrage lifted.</p><p>I was almost afraid to look around and see a leg missing. A quickglance assured me it was still with me, however mangled it might be.At that moment I began to curse, screaming at the top of my voice,every God Damned swear word in my vocabulary and then some. Thisseemed to ameliorate my anger and panic somewhat. By the time Taylorreturned with the medic and the stretcher I had pretty well calmeddown. He declared , " I wasn't expecting to find you two alive afterall that stuff." I insisted that they take Carrothers out first,since he was in far worse shape than me. He was then unconscious.Someone could come for me later. The medic cut off my pants andunderwear legs, dusted the lacerated area with Sulfa Powder andapplied a bandage. They hurried off with Carrothers. While the medicwas tending to me, I had taken note of one of our machine gunemplacements at one side of the clearing. I crawled over and joinedthe crew in their spacious foxhole. And none too soon as a anotherbarrage ensued. Later, when I was just beginning to feel some pain, alieutenant popped in and gave me a shot of morphine. From then on Iguess I was on a trip, or simply ecstatic at the prospect of beingout of this ugly business of waging war.</p><p>After dark two medics showed up, loaded me unto a stretcher andhigh tailed it to a road out back somewhere. As we were going alongthe side of a hill, a Jerry 88 whistled its way to the top of thehill and exploded. The medics dropped to the ground half spilling mefrom the stretcher. It was evident that they were inexperienced. Itold them them I would let them know when it was necessary to hit theground and that the sound of that 88, to my experienced ear,indicated it was not going to hit close enough to worry about.Subsequently, I was loaded into an ambulance among other wounded.After a short drive we were unloaded and placed in one of the largetents of a field hospital. Eventually I was examined by a Doctor, whoinformed me that after an operation, which would be necessary, my legshould be OK. That was a reassuring bit of news. The leg was thencleaned, bandaged and bundled up to keep it immobile.I was given ashot of penicillin in my buttocks and another morphine shot.</p><p>A protracted and uninterrupted period in the arms of Morpheusfollowed. During the ensuing day, after some hot chow, with others Ishipped out in a long bumpy ambulance drive to a Hospital in Liege,Belgium. It was here, following the X-Rays and the proper anesthesia,that the leg was operated on.</p><p>For the next few days I remained confined to bed in the hospital.During which time I had the "thrill?" of experiencing the onslaughtof Buzz bombs on Liege at the rate of two or three a day. Thescenario goes as follows: First the loud putt putt of the ram jetengine: Then an abrupt silence when the engine shut off: For many, apause in activity, a tense anxious ten second ,or so, wait: Then itsdetonation upon impact, God only knew where, and the relief fromtension. I could see that day after day of this could be a bit nerveracking. For myself, having been subjected to concentrated artilleryand mortar fire and survived, I didn't get very up tight. After all,what were the odds of being hit by a single missile, irrespective ofits explosive power? 'Me, the eternal optimist!'</p><p>Then with many others I was transferred to a waiting hospitaltrain. It was turning dark when we pulled out of the rail yards wherewe entrained. As the train left the yards the loud putt putt washeard, then the cut off. The missile impacted in the yards somewhereclose behind us. The blast jolted the train but it kept moving. 'HolyMoses, a close one!' Remember the stupid optimist?</p><p>Our destination was Le Havre, where, upon arrival at a dock area,we were put aboard a hospital ship bound for 'merry?' old England.The channel crossing was uneventful. The landing was made atSouthampton and we were immediately transferred to a train. Fromwhence, we were off to an army hospital in Kidderminster, nearBirmingham.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll8"></a>Recollection 8: Convalescence</h3><p>I remember the ride to Birmingham as being quite pleasant. Luckilyhaving been placed next to a window, I could enjoy looking at thecountry side and towns as the train passed by. I was particularlyrewarded with the sight of Winchester Cathedral.</p><p>The Kidderminster facility consisted mostly of largeinterconnected quonset huts, which provided for spacious andcomfortable wards and other hospital functions. I don't remember muchof the time confined to bed in one of the wards. I know that Irendered some charcoal sketches, which are still extent, wroteletters, and for the most part, did some reading. Of course, Imaintained an active interest in the developments south of the 104INF's sector on the Roer river, (The Battle of the Bulge).</p><p>Christmas came and went with the usual little diversionsassociated with the Holiday. Somewhere about this time, I receivednotification of the award for my 'bravery?' in the H&uuml;rtgenforest, which surprised me. I was not aware that I had done anythingnoteworthy. I certainly had not felt particularly intrepid or braveat the time. On the contrary, it was an extremely frighteningexperience. In any event, it made me feel good that I had at leastattained some level of distinction. (Hey, I'm an intrepid soldier ofvalor!)</p><p>Once I was ambulatory, albeit with the aid of crutches, I began towander about the facility, the Rec rooms, the library such as it was,and the PX. It was in the latter I decided, that if I was going tosmoke, it must be the pipe. As a consequence, I bought my first pipeand a small tin of tobacco, which began what was to be some fifty oddyears with that damn thing in my mouth.</p><p>By the middle of January I was navigating without the crutches andundergoing some physical therapy. I attended some USO affairs inKidderminster, (Boy meets Girl type), where indeed, I did meet agirl. However, what was developing into a serious affair was cut off.I received orders to report to an Army Depot in London. Post haste, Iwas hustled, along with others, aboard a train to London town. At thedepot we were issued new clothing, combat stuff. It was then Ilearned that I was slated to return to my unit in the 104th Div. Notbeing a gung-ho type, I hardly found this bit of news heartening.</p><p>Of course being at the depot was the usual situation, known in thearmy as,'hurry up and wait.' As a result, I had time on my hands,roughly a week or so. I volunteered for duty at the supply counter,with the hope that I might make myself indispensable, and that theSergeant in charge would have me transferred to his quartermasterunit. Needless to say, the ruse didn't work. On evening and weekendpasses I again attended USO functions. At a dance, I met another girl(picked up?) and became involved enough to be invited to her homeover the weekend. There our 'love?' was consummated.</p><p>It was during this brief stay in London that I experienced anothergreat 'thrill?', the infamous V-2 Rocket strikes on the city. Thescenario was much simpler than the Buzz-Bomb case. There was no soundpreceding the detonation upon impact. If you heard and felt the earthshaking explosion, you had survived.</p><p>Monday was indeed blue one for me; I received my shipping ordersand forthwith put aboard a ship bound for Le Havre. It was all quitedepressing. There was no guessing about what I was going into thistime. The only thing I remember about the trip was a protracted trainstop in Rouen. Here I had the opportunity to examine closely it'smagnificent cathedral, both inside and out. The view of the soaringarches inside were breath taking. I have never forgotten thesensation I had as I looked up into that vaulted ceiling.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll9"></a>Recollection 9: The Roer river, pps221-227.</h3><p>A few day's or so were next spent at a fitting station nearAachen. Among other things a new M1 Rifle was issued, which had to beunpacked, cleaned of the packing grease,(a messy task), andassembled. Then some time spent at the firing range, breaking in, andpracticing my skills with, the weapon. Again hoping to forestall theinevitable, I volunteered for work at the supply desk, but to noavail. With other replacements, all with no previous combatexperience, we were trucked out to 2nd Battalion Headquarters inWeisweiler. The city had been thoroughly battered, first frombombing, then from heavy artillery, then by the attack to wrest itfrom the Wehrmacht. There was barely a building standing that wasn'tsignificantly damaged. It was sickening to see so much destruction. Iwas yet to see considerably worse than this.</p><p>We were, unceremoniously, dumped off at a large building servingas a collection center near the center of the city. Here, while thegreenhorns were marched off to pre-combat training, I awaited therunner from Co. G, who was to show me the way to where the thirdplatoon was stationed. It turned out to be somewhere near the Roerriver. It was just outside a town called Merkin, I believe. On theway there we made our through more mud, the sticky ooze-y kind, thanI had ever encountered before or thereafter. G Co's billets were in acluster of three or four buildings, damaged but habitable.</p><p>Aside from from the three or four new faces in the platoon, itscharacter seemed much the same as it was when I abruptly left it backin November. "Hey Beeken, we were waiting for you to come back beforemaking the big push across the Roer." I felt right at home as Isettled in."Thanks a lot guys." Activity, for the next ten days orso, consisted of short duty tours at outposts on the river, andpractice sessions with assault boats on the Inde river near Inden. Atnight we were treated to visits by Bed Check Charley, a Luftwaffephenomenon, buzzing about in the night sky. His characteristicbehavior was to drop a flair, which would light up a likely target,and thereupon drop a bomb or two. One night he was heard directlyoverhead and next the fluttering sound of a flair coming down. Theplace lit up outside like a Christmas tree. Being on the second floorwe scurried like rats down the stairs to the cellar. "Varoom!" Thebuilding shuddered and plaster fell, but remained standing. When theflair burnt out and the dust settled we went back up to our sacks andsome more sleep. The morning light revealed that the company latrinejust outside had been obliterated. 'The Heine was playing dirtypool', was the general consensus.</p><p>It was about this time that the platoon leader and sergeant of the2nd platoon asked me over to their quarters next door to discuss atransfer from the 3rd platoon. Lieutenant Mahl, who had been awardeda battlefield commission while I was away, was in need of a squadsergeant, and for some reason along with his platoon sergeantConnelly seemed to think I was the man for the job. (An intrepidvaliant soldier, what?). "So what the hell, why not?", I thought. Itmeant a promotion to three Bars, higher pay, and as far as I coulddetermine no change in my vulnerability to the 'slings and arrows ofoutrageous warfare' to paraphrase a line of Shakespeare.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll10"></a>Recollection 10: The Drive to Cologne, pps277-233</h3><p>Finally, after a false start, the big push was on, and it was tobe a night attack. I was still in the third platoon, since thetransfer had not come through as yet. After the briefing thatafternoon we were issued the extra ammunition, grenades, etc. deemednecessary. I chose to arm myself with the new antitank rifle grenadesrather than the fragmentation type. 'Who knows maybe I'll have anoccasion to knock out a tank?' At midnight we marched out to theassault boats arrayed near the riverbank. The skies were clear and amoon could be seen low in the sky, which provided some visibility ofthe terrain ahead, an advantage that could work both ways for thecombatants involved. Our river crossing was a few kilometers northand downstream of the city of Duren, which was situated on theopposite bank of the river. It was a major objective in the overallassault. Our objective, along with Co E, was to take over the twintowns of Huchen-Stammeln, two or three kilometers further insideGermany and east of Duren, now effectively a fortress. Stammeln, thenorth east section, was our assignment.</p><p>While awaiting the order to push off, the adrenalin was up andnobody talked. Even so, there seemed to be an air of confidence aboutthe outcome of this attack. The briefing had indicated that theplanning for this operation had been thorough and was as fool proofas humanly possible. At about 3:00 hours the preparatory barragecommenced. The one we witnessed over the Mark river in Holland wasimpressive, but this far surpassed it in volume and intensity. Thisman made hell was a solid roar of air and ground bursts. It sweptfrom the opposite bank to a kilometer or so beyond. It was notpossible to distinguish between shell bursts. Surely, no man couldsurvive under that fire. If he did, it would have driven him starkravingmad, at least it would have me.</p><p>The moment the barrage ceased, each platoon grabbed it's boats,rushed to the rivers edge, launched, and rowed across to the oppositebank. As our boat approached the opposite shore, a machine gun to ourright in Co. E's sector began firing. From its position, somewhere upon the bank, it swept its fire up and down the river. Hearing theplop of the bullets hitting the surface of the water near by was abit unnerving. So, when the boat was about four feet from the shore,I jumped out, thinking it should be shallow at that point. I went inhalf way up to my chest, where four anti-tank grenades were hung.'Whew!', that water was ice cold. Luckily, I kept my footing (theweight of the extra ammo probably helped) and clamored up the riverbank. To keep warm I started walking briskly eastward away from theriver, water gurgling about in my combat boots with every step.Presently, Capt. Maulden, our present company commander, caught upwith me asked if I was off to fighting this battle all by myself. Ihad to chuckle and explained my real purpose. He took a look at myrather damp condition and said he could see that I was all wet, butwhen he saw me move out so fast, he thought I was all wet in adifferent sense. "There is a limit to this valor stuff you know". (Alittle humor in the heat of battle. It has been said 'that if youaren't able to exercise a little levity in a lousy situation, you area candidate for section 8.')</p><p>I remained with him as we proceeded at a slower pace. Meanwhileelements of the rest of the Company began to catch up with us but notin any particular order. The terrain was open and flat, denselypocked marked with shell holes, all the way to our objective, whichat this distance appeared as a jagged dark silhouette, near thehorizon. Up to this point we had encountered no enemy fire. Had thatbarrage really wiped out all the enemy defenses? Subsequently we cameto a railroad running across our line of advance, about half akilometer from the town. We were ordered to spread out along the lowembankment and await further orders. I positioned myself close to theCaptain and his radio man who had just came up. To keep enemy headsdown in our coveted piece of real estate, he requested some 80 mmmortar rounds thereupon. Subsequently, the order "Move out", came andon to our objective we went.</p><p>The second platoon split off into first group of buildings to ourright. The rest of us moved further along to a line of buildingsstraddling a road leading eastward out of the town. Along the way Ithought I detected in the semidarkness some movement at a window. Ifired my first antitank grenade. The blast just inside the window wasimpressive. Apparently, I had acquired a lethal addition to myarmament. The Captain directed us to one of the larger buildings,which he wanted to use as the Company headquarters. We fanned out ina protective screen as a squad searched it for possible enemyoccupants. One pathetic looking 'kraut' captured was the prize.Meanwhile the sound of small arms fire and grenades emanated from the2nd Platoon sector, with the occasional "kapow" of what sounded like37mm antitank gun. After a brief conference with the captain, Lt.Turner, my platoon leader came to me as I was investigating a rubblestrewn space between two buildings. He instructed me to take four mento the street, go down the right side to the building at the end, andset up an outpost with a good field of view for spotting possiblecounter attacks. By this time it was becoming quite light.</p><p>I gathered up Mcklintock, a BAR(Browning Automatic Rifle) man,three riflemen, and a runner. We dashed across the street into theshell shattered building on the other side. We drew no fire. It wasthen I reasoned, "Why move up in the street vulnerable to fire fromboth sides, when it appeared that we could proceed on the groundlevel through the shells of the buildings with at least some cover.The others agreed and so, with me leading, we cautiously wended ourway from building to building through windows and breaks in the sidewalls. Presently, we came to one whose facade was completely gone. AsI peered through a gap blown through wall separating the building wewere in from the next, I looked across the street. 'Lo, and behold',there appeared three of the enemy with their rifles coming out of adoorway. I brought my weapon to bear with an antitank grenade andyelled, "Ubergeben! Kommen sie hier!" They scrambled back into thedoorway. I fired the grenade which impacted just inside the doorsill. Since the structures were built primarily of stone in this partof Europe, one can imagine the amount of shrapnel created by theblast of the grenade. I quickly loaded and fired a second grenadewhich detonated deeper back inside the doorway. We then proceeded tothe end building without further incident. Except for it's roof,which was almost completely gone, the edifice was in fairly goodcondition, and showed signs having been recently occupied. A coupleof grenades, rolled down the cellar stairs, produced shoutsof,"Kamarad!", and then six rather shaken prisoners of war. ThePlatoon Sergeant, subsequently, showed up and took over. He had beendelayed by a problem with the boat he was in. One of the guys thatcame with the Sergeant had gone into the building into which I hadfired the antitank grenades and told me he found two dead 'krauts'and a third in very bad shape. He began to go into more detail, but Iasked him to please not to. I didn't want to hear about it.</p><p>Inspection of the cellar revealed a dozen comfortable doubletiered bunks and assorted furniture. After cleaning up the debriscaused by the grenades, we had ourselves a right cozy quarters.Having not been assigned lookout duty, I forthwith hit the sack inthe bunk of my choice. No sooner had I done so then the "thunk,thunk, thunk" sound of mortars being fired was heard. 'Now what thehell?' We all rushed up the stairs at the top of which we met thelockout coming down from the second floor. He informed us that enemymortars set up in the farm diagonally across the road were beingfired in the direction of the river. Well, we couldn't allow thatsort of mischief to continue unabated and unpunished. So I bolted upthe two flights of stairs to the attic floor with a BAR man,Mcklintock, and two riflemen following. Looking over the stone roofsupport we had an unobstructed view of the battery consisting ofthree mortars in the yard at one side of the little farm. Thedistance was about 100 yards. The crew of a dozen men, or so, busilymanning the mortars, were apparently unaware that their enemyoccupied the adjacent town. The barrage the night before hadapparently played hob with their communications system. I fired thegrenade I had on the rifle into the middle of the battery array,while the BAR opened up on full automatic (effectively a machine gunon that setting) and the two M1's commenced firing . As the crewscampered for cover, I fired my last grenade into their midst. Mostof them were probably cut down by the BAR before they got very far.The rest were picked off individually by our M1's, until nothing wasstirring, (not even a mouse). Subsequently, we went back down to ourbunks. After eating a K ration I sacked out and slept until thefollowing morning.</p><p>I awoke just in time for some hot chow. Apparently, the ArmyEngineers had successfully spanned the river with a Bailey bridge ortwo. Our kitchen was in town as well as some tanks and SP's,(selfpropelled guns), parked at a safe distance down the street. I wasinformed of a patrol's report on the previous day's turkey shoot. asit was now described. "Ten enemy dead and signs of wounded havingbeen removed." Then came the disturbing news that we were to preparefor a night attack that evening. 'Hey! What happened to the usualleap frogging policy? Somebody is supposed to move through us to thenext objective.' But of course our griping was to no avail. Late thatevening, provided with the fresh ammunition allotted to us during theday, we strung out along both sides of the street leading east out oftown. In the silence, as we awaited the order to move out, I had anoverwhelming sense of foreboding. Why wasn't there a preparatorybarrage? This action was not going to turn out well at all! Then ajeep drove by me and up to the head of the two columns. Where therewas, what seemed to be, a brief conference and the jeep left as itcame. You can imagine the feeling of relief when the order came downto return to our posts. Why the attack was aborted, I never foundout.</p><p>The next morning, after an early chow, the attack again wasordered. We formed up as before and trudged out in a two columnapproach march formation. Our objective was a town called Oberzierlocated on what was considered some strategic high ground about threeto four kilometers to the east. We headed out across the interveningmeadows because the the road was impassable. It was heavily mined andlarge trees had been felled across it all along its length. Lt.Turner, the 3rd Platoon leader, led the columns. I was the fourth manin the right column. As we approached and came closer we could see ahigh stone wall on this side of the town. At about 150 yards machinegun fire emanated from the wall. Along with everyone else I hit thedirt with the snap of bullets going by. I looked up between bursts offire and saw Lt. Turner running to the left and go down at the nextburst. It looked like he had been hit. After laying there for awhile,with an occasional snap of bullets above, and debating whether to digin or not, I heard the sound of two howitzer shells going overhead.One hit in front of the wall the other on the roof of the structurejust behind the wall. Great! The son of a bitch was being zeroed in.When the fire for effect was completed, a good part of that wall hadbeen reduced to rubble. We then moved with alacrity through the gapsand into town without any further argument from the enemy. We roundedup a considerable number of them, the majority of which were caughtsleeping. They had been at their defensive posts all the previousnight expecting a night attack. Quite a few seemed genuinely happy tobe captured and that the war for them was over.</p><p>I was assigned the task of leading a detail to escort the captivesback through the wall to rear echelon units. As we started out two88's came in and struck a stone wall quite close by. They were ofsuch a low trajectory that nobody had time to hit the ground. One ofmy men and a prisoner were struck by shrapnel. As soon as the medicarrived to tend to them, we hustled our prisoners down and outthrough the wall. There we found an armored unit assembled, a coupleof Sherman tanks and armored cars. We turned over our captives andreturned to town. Our losses were several wounded and one dead, Lt.Turner.</p><p>Lt. Mahl came over to me and said I was now a member of the 2ndplatoon and under his command; the promotion to sergeant would beforthcoming. That night we billeted in the quarters formerly occupiedby the enemy. A long sleep that night was accompanied with the notinfrequent salvos of an artillery battery which had set up next tothe town. Here we remained for a day or two. The respite, of course,couldn't last forever. We were soon on a long approach march northeast to a town called Oberaussen. We crossed over a canal and, whilethe rest of the battalion attacked the town, G Co. was directed alonga high ridge south of the town. The 2nd platoon was in the lead. Inoticed with apprehension that the road on which we were advancingmust must be a clear target seen from the high ground off to ourleft. I was up near the front of the column with Lt. Mahl and theplatoon Sargent, when the bombardment abruptly began, as I hadanticipated. We all dove into the roadside gullies. They were thedreaded 88s. With their high speed and low trajectory it is extremelydifficult to get to the ground before they hit. Though the barragewas short lived, five minutes or so, two casualties resulted. Onedead and the platoon sergeant with a severely lacerated right arm. AtLt. Mahl's request (order?) I escorted him back along the road tofind a medic. Upon arriving at the edge of the town, previouslybypassed, we encountered an Aid Station being set up. I left himthere in good hands, and with the usual pit of fear in my stomach,trudged reluctantly back to the platoon. They had, in the interim,moved on and up the slope of the ridge to a wooded tract at the top.When I finally caught up they were digging in at the other side ofthe woods at the top of the ridge, looking out over a flat plainbelow. Lt. Mahl then informed me that I was now the Platoon Sergeantand requested (ordered?) that I dig a two man foxhole, while he wentto confer with the Company Commander. Two promotions within a week,albeit the result of misfortunes of others; "Gadzooks!" I was reallymoving up in this man's army.</p><p>Before digging I took a moment to ponder the turn of events and tohave a good look at the plain laid out below the ridge and reachingout in the distance to the east. Dusk was upon us; but one couldstill make out the highway in that direction littered with smashedand still burning tanks and various vehicles. Our aircraft and fastmoving armored units were having a field day on that terrain. Avillage was also just barely visible several kilometers away. On aclear day, Cologne could probably be seen from the ridge. I was abouthalf way to completing the foxhole dig, when Lt. Mahl returned andannounced we were moving out immediately. ("Shit!" All that diggingto no purpose. No rest for the weary wicked! "Haven't we walked farenough today?") It was a bitching collection of GIs that trekked downthe slope of the ridge to the highway. It was learned that ourdestination was the village seen from the ridge. When that bit ofintelligence filtered down through the trudging columns our spiritswere somewhat lifted by the prospect of more comfortable quarters forthe night.</p><p>It was our first encounter with a civilian population. The advancehad been so rapid and unexpected that the inhabitants had not hadtime to flee. Consequently, we either simply moved into domicileswith, or displacing, the inhabitants. It was interesting to note thevarious reactions; either one of sullen compliance, denials ofsympathy with the Nazi regime, or a curiosity about these foreignerswith the gall to invade the sacred soil of Germany.</p><p>Because of the flat open terrain, the armored units were advancingquite rapidly. As a consequence the next few days consisted of seriesof forced marches to occupy towns, successively closer to the' bigcity', that the armor had swept through. Very little or no resistancewas encountered by G Co. in so doing. At the outskirts of the city wewere held up briefly until all the participating elements of the414th and 415th Regiments were on line for a coordinated attack intothe city proper. The advance was initiated early in the morning , thesky overcast with a light intermittent drizzle. E Co., I believe, ledour foray into the city down a narrow street, G Co. following withthe 1st, 2nd, and 3rd platoons in that order, with two columns, oneon each side of the street. The movement was slow with halts,coinciding with the sound of small arms fire and grenade explosion upfront, every now and then. We had ample time to have close up looksat the destruction wrought by the frequent heavy bombings of thecity. The devastation was unbelievable. How does one describe alandscape of building skeletons and rubble. Here and there, a largearea of rubble only, with a huge crater in the center would be seen.(A 'Blockbuster Bomb'). Sorties into structures through ground floordoorways was physically too hazardous to go very far inside.</p><p>Eventually the 2nd Platoon fanned to the right alone. Now, therewas no one between us and the enemy. Adrenalin levels rose, as weproceeded down a wide avenue with trolley tracks running down thecenter. It led downward four or five blocks to a square at the bottomof the grade. The skeleton of a wrecked and burned out trolley wassituated about two thirds of the way down. Since the scene did notappear particularly threatening and I had no strong feelings oftrepidation, I took the point. I moved down the center of the avenueskirting bomb craters, while the platoon, properly spaced, moved downthe side walk on my right. About half way down machine gun fireemanating from the square had us ducking for cover. Fortunately therewas a bomb crater next to me at that moment where I found cover. Theymade a thorough sweep up the avenue, ricocheting bullets flyingeverywhere. When the fusillade ceased I assayed a sneak peek at thesquare over the rim of the crater. Through the ribs of the street carin my line of sight I saw a couple of the enemy scurrying across thesquare. The snap of a snipers bullet past my head cut my observationshort. I immediately slid lower down into the crater. Subsequentpings had me sliding successively lower until I was at the bottom ofthe crater. To my right the crater rim was much lower and I could seeLt. Mahl and several men of the platoon. They were in a recess in thefacade of what had been a bank. They were looking at me and laughing!('What The Hell? What's so funny about a man squirming to avoidgetting his head shot off?') A little pissed off I fixed the grenadeadapter on my rifle. I set the stock down on the ground so that itwas in a mortar like attitude. I fired off the two antitank grenadesI had hanging on my chest.They were lobbed in the general directionof where the shots had come from, which I guessed was an upper floorof a building about half a block to my left down the street.</p><p>Lt. Mahl then motioned me over to their refuge. There were noshots as I dashed to the recess. I was told that the two grenades haddetonated on the sidewalk down the street. The sniper probablythought they were mortar bursts zeroing in on his position and'skee-dadled'. Then from up the street came the welcome sound of aSherman tank coming down to join us. As it came abreast of us, itfired its cannon and opened up with its machine guns on the square.('Son a Beecha! That muzzle blast hurts the ears.') We then pushed ondown to the square where we found several enemy dead and assortedweapons lying about.</p><p>Not knowing the whereabouts of the rest of G Co., we held up atthis point. Shortly, a Jeep drove up and informed us that the citycenter was in our possession and to follow them. Lt. Mahl got in theJeep, the rest of us climbed atop the tank and we all barrel-assedoff into the sunset, I mean, down a main thoroughfare to within ablock or so of the Cathedral square. On our way we passed a stillburning Tiger tank with a large hole just above the tread on thatside. It had apparently was out maneuvered by the new Pershing tankwith its 90 mm cannon. It had met more than its match.</p><p>Lt. Mahl and I found a billet previously used by our erstwhile foea block away from the square. It was in the basement of a largecommercial building of some sort. It had one perturbing aspect, andthat was the un-detonated block buster bomb protruding out of therubble of the building next door, it's fins in full view. However,since it apparently had been there for quite some time unexploded, itwasn't very likely to do so now, a conclusion apparently shared bythe previous tenants. An outpost was established in a building nearand with a view of the river and its opposite bank. One of my dutieswas seeing to a periodic replacement of the detail assigned to it. Onone such occasion, when I was bringing in a relief detail a stray 88struck at the far corner of the room and blasted in. The concussionknocked down those of us in the room but aside from some minorscratches nobody was seriously hurt. But the intensity of thatconfined blast left me with considerable less hearing for a day ortwo and a noticeable ringing in my ears (tinnitus) which is stillwith me today.</p><p>As a reminder that the war wasn't over and that the enemy hadn'tlearned to love us yet, we were subjected to occasional mortar roundsand 88s from over the river. Most of them impacted in the cathedralsquare. (Le Boche being soreheads and poor losers were simply ventingtheir anger at having this piece of real estate wrested from them)The Cathedral, looming almost unscathed above the almost completedestruction surrounding it, was an amazing and a quite unbelievablesight. One day I decided I had to get inside and have a look around.So timing the intervals between mortar rounds as best I could, Idashed across the square and into the cathedral. What met my eyes wasdisappointing. Because of the completely sandbagged windows it wasquite dark and it was not possible make out much in detail. I did notlinger and scurried back the way I came.</p><p>The few civilians wandering about were a constant wonder to me asto how they could have survived the rain of high explosives withouthaving gone stark raving mad, let alone, with their lives. The humanbeing must have an enormous capacity for endurance. My one face toface encounter resulted in a learning experience. I was standing onthe sidewalk at an intersection smoking my pipe, when an oldgentleman came up to me with a beautiful old briar pipe in his hand.It obviously had been well used. He somewhat abashedly kept pointingto the pipe and uttering, "Hatten Sie tobac; haff tobacca?" I thoughtat first he wanted to sell the pipe to me, but then I realized thatwhat he wanted was some tobacco. I could also see that begging wasnot his accustomed behavior. The craving for nicotine had overcomehis pride. Something, that today, I can well understand. I looked athis pipe and saw that it had a thick layer of carbon around theinside. With my limited command of German and his smattering ofEnglish he managed to convey to me the purpose and importance ofmaintaining that layer to keep the pipe cool and smoking sweet.Needless to say, he was provided with tobacco from my stash.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll11"></a>Recollection 11: The Remagen Bridgehead,pps. 293-296</h3><p>We remained ensconced in the cathedral area for about a week orthereabouts, whereupon, we learned of the capture of the RemagenBridge over the Rhine river. The big question was: Were we slated togo to the aid of the 1st Division in securing the bridgeheadestablished on the other side, or were we to be held in reserve? Inanswer to our question, we were relieved by elements of the 8thDivision and moved out to the suburbs somewhere. A day or so later,early in the morning, we loaded into trucks and hi-balled it southdown a highway on the west bank of the legendary river, sopopularized by Wagner's Operas. Through the early morning mist risingfrom the river, the craggy hills rising above the opposite shore werequite visible. Even a few castles were seen silhouetted against thedawning east.(Das Reingold or Die Walkyrie we didn't spot, nor hearda "YOHOKOHO".Not even a Reinm&auml;dchen was seen about.)</p><p>Though the bridge was still standing, its damaged condition, dueto an attempt to blow it up in the face of the 1st Army advance,subsequent bombing and shelling, and initial heavy traffic inestablishing a beachhead on the west side, made it too precarious forfurther use. It was closed. However, our intrepid Army Engineers hadsucceeded in constructing a Treadway Bridge under constant enemy firea bit north across the river. (the longest one in history and aremarkable feat). With a brief pause to establish proper spacingbetween trucks, we were whisked across to the other side. We had aclear broadside view of the damaged bridge. In spite of herculeanattempts to shore it up for continued use, it tumbled into the riverthe following day.</p><p>The trucks sped us through the village at the banks of the riverand up into the hills on the other side. The sounds of battle werewith us again. We de-trucked, formed up into our respective companiesand trekked out in an approach march formation, G Co. leading. Later,as we proceeded, the other companies branched off to our left andright establishing a broader advancing front. We broke out into aregion of high rolling hills with broad open spaces with substantialwooded tracts dispersed here and there. As we trudged up one of thosehills we were subjected to fire from, of all things, an Ack-Ack gun.The 50 caliber tracer bullets over our heads, of course, had us downon the ground. Since the tracers pinpointed the location of the gun,the 1st Platoon on the point had no difficulty in maneuvering tosilence it with a few well placed grenades. We suffered no casualtiesin this encounter. At length, we entered a village that hadpreviously been under artillery fire and or fighter aircraft attacks.No resistance was encountered. In the street near the center of townwere two wrecked armored vehicles, still burning, along with a houseor two. This was apparently our assigned phase line for the day. Itwas, by then late afternoon with time to establish our defensiveposture against a possible counter attack, and, more important,satisfy the inner man. As to the latter, one had two choices from themenu: K or C ration. I preferred the latter.</p><p>The next day we moved on but had no further direct contact withthe enemy. Near the end of the day we were again ensconced in a townfor the night. Our trudge to this objective, however, was not withoutentertainment. With nice clear skies, we were treated to the sight offighter aircraft flying overhead and swooping down on targets to theeast and north of us. From high ground, when we were on it, we couldactually see the smoke trails of the rockets they fired, andsometimes a plume of smoke from an exploding target. This usuallymeant one less tank or self propelled 88 that could threaten us withbodily harm. This action, quite naturally, elicited rousing cheersfor the Air Force. (Go to it Baby!). This activity called TacticalAir Support was a bit of, 'Jolly well done, Pip Pip and all that', asour British counter parts would say. They were now across the Rhinealong with the 9th Army and streaming out into Germany from Holland.(Could the end be far off?)</p><p>The domination of the air by our forces and the rapid movement ofthe armored and infantry elements ( ala Rommel's Blitzkrieg method,perfected by Patton) kept the Wehrmacht completely off balance.Daytime movements by the enemy were severely constrained. There wereno more set battle engagements. The inadequate attempts to mountcounter attacks were quashed almost before starting. We were gettingthere 'firstest with the mostest', to cite the famous dictum ofGeneral Marshall, the logistics genius of this war.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll12"></a>Recollection 12: Across the Third Reich.pps 296-361.</h3><p>The scenario developed into a series of day to day treks and ortruckings from place to place in the wake of the armored unitsdeploying to the east toward Leipzig. Units leap frogged one anotherwith occasional clashes, usually brief, with desperate isolatedelements attempting to stem the flood. But their efforts were to noavail. It only resulted in unnecessary destruction and loss of lifeand limb. At least, that is how it was to my mind. (Here we are inthe heart of Germany and the Russians advancing rapidly on theeastern front particularly in the direction of Berlin. The war shouldbe ended. (Im Deutschland alles kaput!)</p><p>In the narrative following, I shall cull from this somewhat hecticactivity across Germany what events that most clearly stand out in mymemory. Distinctive memories of the 'uneventful' events are lostsomewhere (swallowed up) in the mists of time.</p><p><b>Event One</b>: After a pell mell truck ride and a four or fivemile approach march, we slogged up a long high hill. Near the top weturned off the road and spread out just over the brow and beganestablishing a defensive posture. While I was digging my foxhole, Icould not refrain at times to pause and enjoy the beautiful view fromthis vantage point. We were looking out over a lovely medium sizedvalley with forested hills just beyond. The road wound down theslope, across the narrow part of the valley to our immediate front,and up into the forested side of the hill there. It all seemed sovery peaceful.(A war going on? Where,what war?) That reverie wasshattered by the sound of a fighter plane flying low over our headsin the direction of the hill opposite us across the valley. Tworockets shot out from its wings as it swooped up and away into the'wild blue'. The rockets impacted at a small open area in the woodsthrough which the road led. They in turn initiated loud multipleexplosions, reverberating through the valley, and a mushroom cloud ofsmoke and debris. (Wow! What a show! A close up view of anaircraft-tank encounter.) The next morning when we sped through thearea in trucks a gruesome scene presented itself; a smashed burnedout Tiger tank with some charred mangled bodies lying about. One ofthe rockets had apparently ignited the ammunition stored aboard. Ourvaliant fighter pilots weren't fooling around. That tank was probablymaneuvering out of its hiding from under the trees to make thingsdifficult for us, in clear view, on the hill opposite. Its movementwas detected, which in turn, brought about its denouement.</p><p><b>Event Two</b>: Accompanied by the sound of howitzer shellsshuffling overhead and their explosions well ahead of us, we trudgedalong a road cutting through a forested area. We came to the edge ofthe woods in sight of a hilltop village undergoing bombardment byboth air and ground bursts. As we came out from the trees the barragelifted. (Perfect timing eh? Of course. Didn't you know? We've turnedinto a crack outfit!) We scurried up up the slope and into thevillage with the dust of the bombardment still settling and without ashot being fired. We executed a quick sweep of the dwellings in ournow practiced fashion: smashing in doors and windows, an occasionalgrenade tossed in for added insurance. (In effect breaking andentering. (Under normal circumstances a felony, I believe.) Exceptfor some enemy dead in the street not a living soul was encountered.Just inside a doorway, I inadvertently stepped on a body covered withdebris. The squishy footing induced me to look more closely. Brushingsome of the debris aside revealed the still warm body of a Wehrmachtofficer, Lieutenant I think, and quite dead. I felt rather sickenedas I went to the next house. Though the village appeared to have beendeserted there were signs of some recent activity. There were somemortars, field guns and related gear laying about. Traces of therecent presence of motorized vehicles were also evident. As we werecompleting our sweep of the village, one of our lookouts was heard toshout,"Hey look what's coming!" Lo and begory, coming out of thewoods beyond the village, was a kraut soldier waving a white cloth onthe end of a long branch. When he came forth, as he was bid, otherssuccessively queued up behind him. All in all, we garnered aboutthree dozen prisoners or so. One their members who spoke Englishrather well asked me where the automatic artillery came from.</p><p><b>Event three</b>: It was one of our longer treks on foot throughfairly rugged territory, high craggy hills, which for the most partwere heavily forested. In an approach march formation, we trudged,'up hill and down dale', along a winding road, 'into and out of', theforest tracts. Eventually we arrived at a crossroads, whereupon, wewere ordered to disperse under the trees along the road and awaitfurther orders. Now, we had been on the move, either by truck orfoot, for the past few days and the company kitchen had been unableto keep pace with us. Consequently, we were forced to subsist on Kand C Rations and an occasional chicken and a few eggs, and ofcourse, butter and pumpernickel bread scrounged or filched from thelocal citizenry. We were also reaching the vanishing point in ourstores of goodies, such amenities as candy bars , cigarettes, and inmy case pipe tobacco. However, we had the good fortune of having anarmored unit pull up near us, two Sherman tanks and several armoredpersonnel carriers. Their vehicles provided ample space for storingsuch goods, which, because of their mobility, they could use forbarter amongst friend and civilian foe. In the army it got to be awell known fact, that if you needed something and were not able toobtain through normal channels, one could always obtain it from them;for a price of course. Sometimes not, it depended on thecircumstances, as it was in our case. (After all, weren't we buddiesfacing the Hun, out there somewhere, plotting to do us all in. We'rein this together). It was like a day in the PX for Co. G. For me,extra tobacco, and even, another pipe they happened to have on hand.</p><p><b>Event Four:</b> G Company was held up at the edge of thevillage by a sniper who had taken pot shots at the approachingcolumns. The search and destroy mission was assigned to the 2ndPlatoon. We maneuvered to enter from another direction. As wefurtively moved down the street we pealed off in pairs into thehouses. With the BAR man I entered the last one on the street. Weproceeded with the usual technique of one covering the other as wewent from room to room. It was at the last room on the second floorthat a shot rang out and a bullet went by the right side of my facenot more than an inch away. Startled, I fired my M1 from the hip, twoshots, at the crouching figure in the doorway, who was just slammingshut the bolt on his rifle. The second shot hit and the sniper keeledover to the floor on his back. He was dead; I could tell. A clearexample of the advantage of possessing a semi automatic weapon suchas the M1 over that of a single shot bolt action one, such as theGerman Mauser. I was still shaking a bit from the fright at the firstmoment of the encounter, when the BAR man, a much more cold bloodedman than I, as I had witnessed several times, came up to me. "HeySarg., that was a great shot,you hit the sun of a bitch dead torights. I would have filled him full of lead but you turned into myline of fire and I couldn't shoot." I thought to myself, 'Onecareless move out of many correct ones can do you in.' Needless tosay G Co. took over that piece of real estate.</p><p><b>Event Five:</b> We de-trucked in a town near Kassel, a goodsized German city. The 2nd Platoon took (Not asked for) lodgings in asmall Inn on the main drag, where we remained in reserve for two daysor so. We wallowed in things, such as, comfortable beds, decentbathing facilities, and, best of all hot chow. The Inn keeper hadonly recently gone off to fight and or die for 'Die Vaterland'. TheWerhmacht's now more liberal induction standards allowed for theacceptance of older men as well as younger adolescent males intoservice. The management of the establishment was left to his, whatseemed to be, rather sullen wife and his attractive daughter.(Sch&ouml;ne M&auml;dchen). One could see that the mother was makinga determined effort to keep her charge in tow and out of contact withthose lusty 'Americanische Soldaten.' Be that as it may, early in thefirst day I was standing in the foyer when the mother with the lovelydaughter went by and up the stairs. I, with my libido of coursearoused, probably stared (ogled) at her inordinately as she went byand up the stairs. As she went up our eyes locked and she smiled.(What Ho?! Was haben sie heir? Maybe something cooks here.) However,there was the matter of the order that came down from armyheadquarters and issued some time past. "No fraternization with thecivilian populace; 'in particular' with the women." (Verboten mit demfr&auml;ulien). From what I had heard, nobody in this division wastaking this directive very seriously. In fact, it was beingcompletely ignored, particularly the 'in particular'. I decided, ifthings developed, to follow suit. Things did develop. How she managedto slip out of sight of her mother, for even the few short periods wehad together, I don't know. With the bit of English she knew and mysmattering of German, we were able to communicate to some extent. Allof which led to some kissing and petting. (Necking?). The final trystwas in the sitting room off the foyer with its windows facing thestreet. As we engrossed ourselves in some real heavy petting, a shoutand sound of a jeep's horn came through the open windows. "HeyBeeken, we're moving out!" I looked up and out the window and therewas Lt. Mahl waving me toward the jeep. With him was Capt. Mauldenand a sergeant whose name I don't recall. I uttered an"Oh No!"grabbed my battle jacket and my rifle and scurried out through thewindow to the jeep and climbed in. Our 'love?'had been leftunrequited. I can't speak for her, but that jeep sped off with onefrustrated 'son of bitch' of a soldier. 'Ah well, such are thefortunes (misfortunes?)' of war. At a good clip we whipped throughthe center of Kassel, where the white flags were still hanging out onnearly every building. We raced through the city, leaving the rest ofthe company in trucks well behind, and headed in the direction of thehills to the north east.</p><p><b>Event Six:</b> It was evening. We had occupied the town latethat afternoon. I was in the process of assigning defensive positionsfor the platoon, When Ken, Lt Mahl, came up to me and said that theCaptain wanted to see me. I went to the house where the companyheadquarters was established. Here, there were gathered a dozen menwith quizzical looks on their faces. Each had been requested to bethere as I had been.The Captain explained that at about 2100 we weregoing on a reconnaissance patrol in strength to look in on aneighboring town, where it was reported that a good sized GermanPanzer Group might be deployed. "I have chosen you men because ofyour experience and I judge you less likely to panic in what mightturn out to be a tough situation. I will be leading this expedition."We were to maintain absolute silence and not fire any weapons unlessit was absolutely necessary to extricate ourselves from theconsequences of discovery by the enemy. At the appointed time we setout along a ridge overlooking a railroad situated down to the right.The sky was overcast with the moon behind allowing for limitedvisibility. I could just make out the tracks and the telephone polesand wondering if any messages were being transmitted along thosewires at that moment, and when a train had last passed on thoserails. We must have walked about five kilometers before the darksilhouette of our destination was visible. At which point we turnedaway from the railroad over the brow of the ridge and along the slopeon that side toward the buildings at the edge of town. We split intotwo columns. I was the middle man in the one on the left. We were inan open pasture sloping down to what appeared to be a road, as nearas I could make out. We continued toward the structures, which becamemore distinct as we neared. Suddenly a panzerfaust exploded in front.As I was hitting the ground there was a flash of light from down atthe road and I just barely discerned the silhouettes of somevehicles. Then nothing, a dead silence. "Christ,"I thought to myself, "If they put a search light on this hillside and with all theweapons they have, this little party of nose pokes would be wiped outin short order." It made one feel somewhat uneasy, you might say. Ireadied my rifle with an antitank grenade with the idea of directingit against any searchlight should it shine forth. After about tenminutes, and nothing transpired Capt. Maulden waving his armsignaling a retreat trotted by. With alacrity I followed suit. We allquickly exited the way we came. No casualties. Later in thedebriefing it was surmised that the panzerfaust was accidental or anoverly nervous new recruit firing at a shadow. It had not struckanywhere near anyone in the patrol. In any event, the informationabout the presence of enemy forces was verified, therefore the patrolwas a success. I thereupon hit the sack. Just before dawn I wasawakened by the freight train sounds of the heavy stuff goingoverhead and explosions in the direction of the town we so brieflyvisited. Later that morning we trekked over to the town, this time onthe road. We found, still smoldering, two tanks, several armoredvehicles, a number of dead, and a dwelling or two on fire. The PanzerGroup had apparently been caught flat footed and had sufferedconsiderable losses before they could 'skee-daddle'. We secured therest of the town without incident and settled in, hopefully, for astay.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Recoll13"></a>Recollection 13: Bitterfeld.</h3><p>Where we were and what we were doing immediately before thisaction, for the life of me, I cannot recall. However, my recollectionof the approach march, (of which I have a photograph looking backthrough the columns), east toward Bitterfeld along a cobble stoneroad and the subsequent events is quite clear, too clear perhaps. Ifind some aspects of it disturbing even today.</p><p>We were in the usual two column formation with F Co. leading theprocession. The rumble of artillery interspersed with sharp sound ofhigh velocity tank and anti-tank guns could be heard far to our rightfront where Halle was being assaulted.We were in sight of theoutskirts, a suburb, of our objective, when small arms fire eruptedat the head of the columns. This necessitated a halt while the leadelements skirmished with the opposition to our advance. Capt. Mauldenthought it might be a good idea to reconnoiter the large pine tractto the left of the road. He suggested to (ordered?) Ken, (Oops Lt.Mahl) that he take his platoon into the woods and have a look around.A few stray Wehrmacht Soldaten may be therein that could be herdedtogether and brought out of harms way, (kept from mischief).</p><p>Whereupon we proceeded down a lane running into the tract from theroad. I took the point because curiosity won over my better Judgment.We hadn't gone very far when I spotted a Kraut soldier at the bottomof the slope. I aimed my rifle at him expecting him to throw up hishands, but instead he ducked back into the trees dropping his rifle.I fired but only managed to chip off some bark where he disappeared.If there are others about then they will be alerted. We would have toproceed with caution. When we reached the area where the kraut fled,we found several dozen civilian automobiles of various makes and agesneatly parked amongst the trees. Apparently the kraut scared off hadbeen on guard duty. To expedite the fulfillment of the Captain'sorder it was decided to split up into two groups and scout out thewhole woods. I lead my group toward the east side of the woods: Ken,(Lt. Mahl) led his toward the west side. Deeper into the woods on ourside we came upon a large fenced in area. Within this enclosure was acollection of, what appeared to be, hastily built open structures inunder the trees, and in which were stacked piles and piles of varioustypes of ammunition.(In short a good sized ammunition dump) 'JumpinJiminy! We'll have to get the engineers in on this, maybe destroyit.' As we went on, the lane we were following turned to the northeast and ultimately led out of the woods. The view there from theedge of the woods had a prairie like aspect to it, flat grain fieldsstretching out to the distance. To the east, about three kilometersaway, a remarkable sight presented itself. A column of tanks andinfantry on foot were moving at a walking pace on a road or highwayheaded north. They were accompanied by shell fire from our artillery.The air bursts over the column could be clearly seen. Apparentlyelements of the Wehrmacht, or what was left of them, were withdrawingfrom Halle with the 'Timberwolf' nipping at it's heels.</p><p>The sound of rifle fire from the west side of the woods cut ourviewing short. We raced through the trees in the direction of theshots. There we found Ken's group rounding up members of an enemypatrol out of the pasture at the edge of the woods. They had beencaught sneaking up on the woods through the pasture. One suffered aflesh wound in the upper leg. The others had dropped their rifles andthrown up their hands. The officer in command started crawling awayfrom us through the shallow growth. He was in plain sight so what thehell was he thinking? He paid no heed to Ken's shouts and keptcrawling, so Ken strode over and gave him a swift and lusty kick inthe ass. When the officer sullenly got to his feet Ken grabbed theLuger from his holster and shoved him in with the others. Theinsignia on his lapels revealed him as a member of the SS, Hitler'selite corps. We lined them up, about a dozen or so, and marched backup to the road and G Co., which had since taken up residence in thesmall suburb to the right of the road. The prisoners were put underguard in one of the buildings. Lt. Mahl and I reported to Capt.Maulden. Apparently the existence of the ammo dump was of interest tothe army engineers. I was asked (ordered?) to guide two of theirinspection crew to the site.</p><p>For insurance, I took along my favorite BAR man and a rifleman. Wemet the pair at the entrance to the woods. They seemed to be somewhatill at ease. (scared?). One asked if they were in the front lines. Ianswered that in a sense, yes, in that there was nothing between usand the enemy ; but, however, that they didn't seem to beaggressively in the immediate vicinity at the present moment. Webrought them to the dump for their inspection. I wanted to go have alook at where we had previously seen the retreating enemy columnunder fire from our artillery. So I went, leaving my two men withthem. There was no sign of the retreating enemy column, but, to myamazement, I did see coming across from my left about a hundred yardsout, probably on a road leading away from the woods, a two columngroup in close order drill formation. They were being led at theirfront by an officer or a noncom, turning to the formation every sooften as they marched and loudly sounding off the cadence. (Eins Sweidrei veir) Except for him they were unarmed. (New recruits undergoingsome basic training? In this situation?) I decided to shoot theofficer, probably SS, break up this little training session, and givethe recruits a little taste of combat fear. I dropped the officerneatly and the column literally evaporated, probably into the gulliesalong the road. Some got up and began running away from the woods asfast as they could. I fired shots over their heads and each time theywould go down. After emptying my clip of eight, I figured that wasenough. I went back to the ammo dump and explained what happened tocalm the fears of the two engineers unnerved by the shots. My two menweren't too concerned because they knew the sound of an M1 rifle.They just wondered what the hell I had found to shoot at. Theengineers had done their job so we trekked back out of the woods andto our respective units.</p><p>Upon returning to our platoon we learned that the company hadorders to attack and seize the Agfa Factories at the edge ofBitterfeld across the way. While we were being briefed about thedetails, all I could think of how stupid it was on the part of theGermans to continue fighting. They were beaten. The war wasessentially over and yet more lives were to be snuffed out, morebodies to be mangled and more destruction. It just didn't make senseand it made me angry. Yes angry enough to want to kill these idiots.'Thus doth waging war make beasts of us all'. (to paraphrase anotherline of Shakespeare). Looking from a second story window, the factorycomplex could be seen about a kilometer or so away from closest ofthe cluster we now occupied. We would have to traverse a broad flatmeadow, on the far side of which, on a low embankment, was a road.Immediately behind the road was a high solid wooden fence runningalong in front of the factory buildings, which were built up from asignificantly lower ground level. One could see only the upper floorsand roofs of the factory buildings and the higher portions of storagetanks in the complex. The road to the right was straddled by a smallgroup of residential buildings at its level. Back toward us from thatangle was some high ground looking suspiciously like it had beenfortified. The consensus was that we should expect resistance to ouradvance. The attack was to begin just before dawn after a preparatoryartillery bombardment. After devouring two C Rations I sacked inuntil awakened at about four in the morning.</p><p>We formed up, 2nd Platoon leading then 3rd and 1st Platoons inthat order. At this time the Company had only occupied the buildingson the side away from the area described with only an outpost on thatside. When the barrage began, we moved through the remaining houses(about a block) to the edge of the group facing the meadow, where wewere to hold up until the barrage ceased. About midway, an air burstexploded nearly over head, then another, Ken who was leadinghesitated. I sensed that something was wrong and urged him to moveforward fast. "That's our stuff! Somebody is zeroed in wrong". Wescampered ahead and ducked into the buildings at the edge of themeadow. Unfortunately the third platoon moved in to take our placewhen several more rounds came in as ground bursts. They suffered manyheavy casualties. One of the battery guns had fired short of thedesignated target, which was the forward area of the factory complexand the high ground to our right. When the barrage ceased, aboutfifteen minutes duration, we set out across the meadow. I took thepoint. No sooner had we done so when out of the half light of earlydawn and from the meadow appeared a dozen or so of the enemy withtheir hands over their heads. Again, the question was asked about theautomatic artillery. What struck me was the apparent age of thisbunch. Except for the leader, they must have been somewhere betweenfourteen and sixteen years of age. They were quickly shuffled off tothe rear and we continued our advance across the meadow.</p><p>By the time we arrived close to the road the dawn was complete. Isignaled for the advance to halt, knelt and scanned along the roadlooking for possible signs of trouble and also a place where we couldget through the high fence that looked to be a very formidablebarrier this close. The foxholes along the road that could bediscerned were abandoned, thus from whence came our captives. Therewas a strong smell of ammonia in the air coming from a ruptured tank,enveloped in a white cloud, behind the fence. At the far right nearthe dwellings straddling the road, was a good sized section of thefence broken down with a big empty foxhole in front. I signaled a goahead and we raced across to the gap in the fence and down into thefactory area. The first building encountered at the bottom of theslope was the power station, in which as we secured it, we surprisedand garnered several more deutsche soldaten. These chaps looked somewhat older than the previous batch. While we were thus engaged, theremainder of G Co. came down and proceeded to seize the buildings onour left along the fence. The odor of ammonia was very strong in thisarea.</p><p>Lt. Mahl next directed the 2nd Platoon up the ridge to the rightalong which stood a row of residential buildings extending over theroad we had previously crossed. Again, I without thinking took thelead. At the top I was startled by a kraut at the corner of thebuilding pulling back and shoving forward the bolt of his Mauserrifle. As he raised his weapon to fire at me, I pulled off two shots.Yes, he was dead, but so young I felt sick. But the waging of warmust go on. While Ken, (Lt. Mahl) secured the buildings along theridge and set up some outposts, I took four men, one with a BAR,Balinski I think, to establish an outpost in the building at the highpoint of the ridge across the road, a very exposed position to anyenemy fire that might come from down below in the city. Before wecrossed the road I took the precaution of making sure the front doorwas open. This I did by firing an anti-tank grenade at the latcharea, ( a loud knock, you might say). The door amazingly, thoughsomewhat worse for the treatment, swung open. We scurried across intothe building and set up the outpost at 2nd floor window, which had anexcellent view of the road as it turned slightly left and down theridge into the city.</p><p>When I returned to other side of the road I found Ken and arifleman between the first and second buildings shooting at a krautsoldier with his rifle running down the slope of a small meadow,which ended at the first line of buildings of the city below. He keptrunning. Those carbines officers carry are notorious for theirinaccuracy. One could not hit the side of a barn door with them.Though a platoon sergeant is also authorized to carry one, I was notabout about to exchange my trusty M1 for that damn thing. Though theM1 was heavier by a considerable amount, its accuracy was more thanworth the effort to carry it. Anyway I aimed, allowing a little lead,fired and he went down. I could tell by the way he fell that he wasprobably dead before he hit the ground. I later learned that thebullet went through his head just below the brim of his helmet. I hadaimed higher than intended or he had decided to duck at that moment.A company runner appeared with the remnants of the 3rd Platoon,informed us where the company headquarters had been established, andthat the Captain wanted a reconnaissance of the rail yard andbuildings beyond the power station and the large building, the thirdfloor of which was now the company Headquarters. We formed up apatrol of adequate size and combed through the freight cars in theyard and the buildings beyond without encountering any of the enemy.After a suitable outpost was established, Ken and I then went toreport to the Captain taking with us a rifleman and a BAR man. Wefound the headquarters cadre at the windows facing west popping awaywith their puny carbines at Kraut riflemen scurrying to the highground on the left. The range was about a hundred and fifty yards.The four of us added to their volleys with our more formidableweapons, particularly the BAR set on automatic fire. It was a turkeyshoot. The BAR probably cut down most of them. We were never informedas to how many were killed and wounded.</p><p>After giving our report, we returned to our stations along theridge. In one of the residences evidence of a recent habitation wasdiscovered in a kitchen. It's table was set with a loaf ofpumpernickel, a tub of butter and some fruit preserves. It was wellpast breakfast time by then, so we sat down to assuage the inner man.While we were enjoying the repast we were startled by the sound ofmachine gun fire and the sharp boom of high velocity cannon. Wequickly grabbed our weapons and went to the front room whose windowslooked out over the little meadow and to the right the road leadingdown into the city. There, coming up the road, was a tank with twocolumns of infantry. The tank fired again at the building in which Ihad set up an outpost when we first came in. We started shooting atthe infantry but the angle from which we had to aim was awkward andthe road was partially obscured by some trees. When the machine gunfire from the bottom of the meadow began to sweep in our direction wehad to back away from the windows. Fearing a coordinating counterattack from the meadow we vacated the outposts along the ridge andretreated down into the rail yards. The BAR man and myself were thelast men to leave. Since I still had two anti-tank grenades, I toyedwith the idea of sneaking up along the back side of the houses to theones on the road, taking the BAR man for fire cover, and positioningmyself where I could 'get' me a tank. Too many unknowns, I thought,besides all of which, coward that I was, why should I risk my lifeand limb now that the end of this fucking war was so near. 'Forgetit!'. When I got down among the others I went to the area between thepower station and the Company headquarters building, where I couldsee the two buildings up on the ridge bracketing the road. As I wasadjusting the launch adapter to the muzzle of my rifle, the tankfired a round along the fence, probably at a target in the nextintersection. I, again, nearly jumped out of my skin. However, thataction did indicate for me that the the tank was between the twobuildings. So I set the rifle in a mortar like attitude and lobbedthe grenades therein. (At the least we would give the krauts a goodscare). After the two explosions the sound of the tank's motor grewfainter.</p><p>As I was wondering about the fate of the men in the outpost upthere, the Company runner appeared and informed us that the tank andthe small group of infantry had withdrawn. They had observed thewhole affair from their third floor vantage point. They hadconsidered calling for heavy mortar fire, but, because of thepresence of our men in the outpost in one of the buildings,refrained. My two grenades detonated close to the tank, one in frontand the other on its right side. They probably reasoned that theywere being zeroed in and decided to pull out. We were ordered toreturn to the high ground. Lt. Mahl had the platoon plus the extrasdivided into two groups. I was to lead one of the groups up the ridgefrom the rail yard side of the power station He was to lead the othergroup up from the opposite side. Just as I was going to lead from thecover of the freight cars a panzerfaust exploded on a tank car downto our left. I hesitated, then made a quick scan of the area from thetop of a box car, and decided it was just a random launch and that anattack from that from quarter was highly unlikely. When we arrived atthe top of the ridge, Lt Mahl was already there with his group. Hewas annoyed that they had gone up alone without us covering. Myexplanation cleared up the matter. We then proceeded to determine,with some foreboding, how the men in the exposed outpost had fared.Except for one, they were a little shaken but alive.This is theiraccount of the action.</p><p>"We were having a field day picking off Krauts coming off the highground to the right of the road. They were trying to get on to theroad and down into the city. Then this tank, all of sudden appearedon the road at the bottom of the slope, raised it's cannon andblasted a hole through the masonry of the third floor. We got thehell out of that second story room and as we were tumbling down thestairs another shell blew in the wall of that room. We scrambled intoa room furthest from that side and laid down flat against the farwall, except for one of us. He panicked and ran out the front doorand was cut down in a hail of fire from a Burp Gun.(A crudelyfabricated Machine Pistol, but effective at close range.) Then weheard, probably an officer, yelling, "Come out with your hands up,bring your wounded!" We just laid there, not moving a muscle. Wecould hear the tank moving up right in front. Then the tank firedagain down the road. A little later came what sounded like two mortarrounds and we heard the tank going back down the road. We stayedhunkered down for a bit expecting a mortar barrage."</p><p>I looked at the body of the dead fellow. The grouping of thebullet holes in his body indicated that the shooting took place atfairly close quarters, no doubt the officer, probably SS. Irecognized the dead man as one of the several replacements, straightout of basic training, that had arrived in the previous week. Again Ifelt angry and sickened by the stupidity of this continuing andunnecessary conflict, and felt a little less uncomfortable about myparticipation in the killing fields during the day.</p><p>That afternoon a Sherman tank joined us and with the 2nd Platoonleading we moved down the road into the city proper. My favorite BARman, I think his name was Balinski, took the point. I stayed alongside of the tank behind him. When he reached the bottom of the slope,where the road turned right and became a street through the closelypacked city buildings, Shots rang out and bullets ricocheted off thestreet. It sounded like a short burst from some kind of automaticweapon. Balinski was wounded in the neck, not fatally, and gothimself out of the line of fire of the next possible burst. TheSherman tank moved down to the bend turned and faced down the street.Nothing was happening so I walked out fifty feet or so in front ofthe tank. Then, a block or so down the street, a kraut soldier ranout of a building, got on a bicycle and started to ride off. I aimedmy rifle to shoot him, when (VAROOM!!) the god damned tank had firedits cannon at the poor bastard. He disappeared in a cloud of smoke,dust and debris. I, again, jumped out of my skin. 'How many times hadI done that? It was getting to be a habit.' Christ!**#! My ears hurt.Then I was overwhelmed with anger. I walked back to the tank andvented my fury by raging at and cursing out the Lieutenant who was incommand. My rifle could have done the job without so much fuckingnoise. He could have had me court marshaled for insubordination to asuperior officer, but instead offered an apology and an invitation toride on the tank with him for the remainder of the advance into thecity. My anger assuaged by my outburst, I accepted. We proceeded wellinto the city without any further encounter, the sounds of battlediminishing as we went. Tinnitus again remained with me for sometime.</p><p>We finally pulled into another factory complex. F Company hadpreceded us and the area was in complete chaos. In the middle of thecampus was a group of jerry built barracks and from which a swarm ofwomen of various ages had emerged. They were milling about cheering,hugging and kissing GIs. They were mostly, as it turned out, fromSlavic countries employed as slave labor in the factories. A few evenprovided a bottle of schnapps for the celebration. I felt already toodrained emotionally and physically weary to join in the festivitiesand sat down on a door sill to simply watch. Then I noticed a ratherattractive girl attempting to evade the crude advances of a fellowwho obviously had no talent for the more subtle methods of seduction.Like Sir Galahad, I went to the rescue of the damsel in distress."Hey buddie I think you're having trouble. Don't you think you'repushing it a little hard?" "Yeah, I guess so. She's a real cunt. Youcan have her and good luck." He walked off. We spent what remained ofthe afternoon together getting acquainted. Her name was Helena, shewas from some small city in Hungary, and she spoke German ratherwell. She even knew a smidgen of English and obviously was possessedof no mean intelligence. She was two years my junior and was verymuch a women and not a girl and I very much wanted to go to bed withher. I had the feeling that she had warmed to me also. That eveningafter chow, (Our kitchen had caught up with us.) we met, asprearranged. I brought some goodies from the chow line, which shedevoured ravenously. I suspected that these people were notparticularly well fed during their incarceration here. We engaged insome necking for a while, and since it was turning quite chilly, shesuggested we go to a meeting of her people. We sat through some talksand sang some songs none of which I understood or knew. We kissedgood night, set a time to meet again late in the morning and she toher barracks, me to my billet in a factory building. I never saw heragain.</p><p>In the morning the platoon headquarters was established in one ofthe buildings housing the drafting rooms. We found some cots and setup our beds amidst the drafting tables. After tending to some minorduties I went to the barracks to meet Helena, but she was no where tobe found. "Wo Helena, where Helena," I kept asking everybody in thebarracks. The only response I could obtain was a shrug of theshoulders and shake of the head. 'Ich weis es nicht.' I tried againthat afternoon and the following morning to no avail. She hadvanished.</p><p>In the following weeks we moved several times to different townsnear Halle, Liepzig and the Mulde river. We were no longer operatingunder combat conditions. Fighting had effectively ceased. TheDivision occupied a broad front along the Mulde river north to Dessaufrom Liepzig. Our only military activity was patrol duty in the areabetween the Mulde and the Elbe river to the east. G company wascalled upon only once to assay a patrol into the area. I was notinvited to go along, though I would have liked to. The encountersexperienced by the patrols consisted mainly of directing elements ofthe Wehrmacht, fleeing the Russians, to crossings over the Mulderiver, and into prisoner compounds. The Russian Army was rapidlyenveloping the east side of the Elbe river.</p><p>Then the 2nd Battalion of the 415th Regiment was assigned the roleof occupying Dessau, where somewhere in the city, G Co. was given theresponsibility of establishing and manning a watch station at abridge over the Elbe river. I have a photograph of the street onwhich the platoon headquarters was located. As this endeavor wasbeing organized we learned of the surrender of the German HighCommand and the official cessation of hostilities. It was a sort ofanti-climax, because we,already,for some time had felt it was over.(For the Wehrmacht alles kaput) Closely following this news was thenotice of the death of Lewis, my younger brother, from the WarDepartment. He had been cut down, by one of those stupid fanaticalattempts to stay the inevitable at the Elbe river, in the 9th Armysector north of us. He was awarded the Silver Star for valor in theaction involved. For the next day, or so, I was in no mood to join inthe boozey celebrations going on in the Company. I brooded about mybrother's death and the senselessness of it all. And how manybrothers had I 'done in' during that stupid bloody day in Bitterfeld,which must have been around the same time, maybe even the sameday."What about that poor guy gunned down at the outpost? Who'sbrother was he? Why my brother and not me?" My mind finally becameall boggled up. Ken (Lt. Mahl) who had been doing his best to comfortme finally induced me to come to the party and have a drink. Onedrink led to another, and another, etc. and for the first time in mylife, I had not only drank hard liquor, but had gotten stinkingdrunk. There was a loose fraulein, a quite attractive blonde, amongthose milling about who attached herself to me. I made the usualovertures with the intention of taking her to bed with me. In thecourse of that courtship during the evenings jollity, I became quiteill. I went outside and up-chucked every thing in my stomach andafter which I had no stomach, you might say, for sex that night. Iwent to my bed and, for the first time in quite a while, had a goodcry and went to sleep.</p><p>When I awoke the next morning I resolved not to think about theGod damned war anymore and move on, performing my various duties andenjoying the little pleasures that came my way. There were, duringour extended stay in Dessau, three other women, besides the blonde,with whom I became intimate. One with which, I also went to bed. Thetime required to fulfill my duties as a Platoon Sgt., including thatof a Staff Sgt., since we didn't have one, was minimal. As aconsequence, I had plenty of free time.</p><p>One day early in our stay, I was on the bridge after changing thewatch when a small group of Russian soldiers strode onto the bridge.They halted, and what looked and acted like a high ranking officercame up to me. In broken English he asked for the whereabouts of ourheadquarters. Motioning him to follow me, I took him to PlatoonHeadquarters where fortunately I found Lt. Mahl, who in turn took theparty to Company Headquarters. When he returned he informed me thatthe officer in question was the equivalent of a Brigadier General,his comrades lower ranking officers of various grades, their ultimatedestination being Division Headquarters. He also said he had somebad, and maybe, some good news for me regarding my promotion to thatfifth stripe. Among the replacements being sent us was a brand newPlatoon Sargent from the states and that my promotion from TechnicalSargent would remain in a pending status. Army regulations did notallow for two sergeants of that rank in the same platoon. However asa consolation prize, so to speak, I was being offered a battlefieldcommission and be sent to OCS (Officers Cadre School) near Paris. Forthe the latter, it was an emphatic 'No Way!' from me. I did not wantto be caught up in the active reserves or have anything to do withanything military after the war was over. As to the former I didn'treally care. What the hell difference was one more stripe going tomean. I would get it sooner or later anyway unless death caught up tome first, which seemed to me more likely if I was to experience anymore combat.</p><p>It was generally assumed that we would become part of the Army ofOccupation in Germany. But 'Gung-ho' General Terry Allen must havewrangled for himself and his Division a role in the PTO, (PacificTheater of Operations). Specifically, participation in the plannedinvasion of Japan was to be our destiny. This was not a very happyprospect to be sure, particularly for me. I wondered about my chancesof survival in another tour of duty under combat conditions. I didn'tfeel very optimistic about it. The strategy for fulfilling thiscommitment went as follows: The Division would move by rail to LeHavre, board ships and sail back to the States. Every man would begiven a thirty day furlough. The Division would reassemble at CampSan Luis Obispo, California, where intensive training in pacific wartactics, particularly beach assaults, would take place. Except forthe furlough, this didn't at all appear to be a very bright future.'But then maybe Japan will fold before we get there'. Hope springseternal!</p><p>The rest is history. The two A-Bombs were dropped while I was onfurlough. Now I could shove the war experience out of my mind and geton with my education, that would be immeasurably expedited by theprovisions in that great piece of legislation the GI Bill of Rights.</p><p><b>FINI</b></p><p>So what does this one particular minuscule experience amongbillions in the history of Homosapiens as a sentient biochemicalchemical organism mean?????? Perhaps a meaningless question, Huh,maybe?? So many questions and so few answers.</p></body></html>
