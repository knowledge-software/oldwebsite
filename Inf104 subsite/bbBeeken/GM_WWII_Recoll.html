One ofthe the courses I registered for was basic ROTC (Field Artillery). Atthe beginning of my junior year had the option of applying forAdvanced ROTC&nbsp;which would have led to a commission of 2nd Lt.upon graduation. However, I chose to devote my efforts at Purdue tofurthering my technical courses, so I declined furtherROTC&nbsp;activity, although I knew full time military service wasnot far away.</P><P>I enlisted on August 7th 1942, and was called to active duty inApril 1943, whereupon I reported to Fort Niagara, New York. I wasassigned to the U.S. Air Force's basic training program at KesslerField, Miss. The air Force became a separate branch during thisperiod.</P><P>Following basic training I was assigned to the Army SpecializedTraining Program (ASTP), and I completed an accelerated course inCivil Engineering at the University of Florida in March 1944.</P><P>In anticipation of the June D-Day invasion of Europe and the needfor infantry replacements, my ASTP&nbsp;class was given it's diplomasand sent to Fort Jackson at Columbia South Carolina for refresherinfantry training. After six months of rigorous training with the84th Infantry Division I was sent to Camp Kilmer, N.J. for deploymentto the European theater. The Queen Mary, which had been converted toa troop ship, carried 10,000 GI's to Glasgow Scotland without escort,departing on the 24th of September and arriving on the 30th. Wedisembarked and after about two weeks were loaded aboard a ship atSouthampton and crossed the English Channel to a Normandy beach.</P><P>Once ashore, we loaded into trucks and were transported via St Loto the Belgium Border. Here I was assigned to the 104th InfantryDivision, which had been just pulled back from the front lines inHolland for redeployment to the Aachen front.</P><P><A HREF="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</A></P><H3><A NAME=Combat></A>Combat:</H3><P>Shortly after I joined the 104th Division, the division was movedto the vicinity of Aachen, Germany. We passed through the city on amoonlit night, which had been utterly demolished by heavy groundfighting and air raids. We detrucked in the morning a couple of milesfrom the front lines. Here the 104th Division relieved the 1stDivision, which had recently hammered its way through portions of theSiegfried Line. This was a German defensive line consisting of wellpositioned, camouflaged and mutually defending concrete and steelpill boxes. It must have been tough going for the Big Red as thedivision was called. There were several knocked out tanks and ashattered pill box in the area we took over.</P><P>Our squad walked about a mile to a liberated pill box still inhabital shape, a company headquarters where we relieved a squad ofthe Big Red. They briefed us about the enemy and the area beforedeparting for a well earned rest probably.</P><P>This pill box faced West with the German lines about a mile to ourEast . There was a high hill that protected us from somewhat fromdirect German artillery fire. To one side of the hill was an openfield then a railroad track and then a woods. The small fieldcontained a minefield with a narrow path through it. The previoussquad had left a couple of large partially covered fox holes at theedge of the woods used as observation posts. One of these holes had atelephone line to company headquarters. There were other fox holesnear the pill box.</P><P>Our squad was to man these fox holes 24 hours a day, and watch forenemy activity. Five men from our squad manned the forwardobservation posts while the others rested manning the fox holesnearer the headquarter's pill box</P><P>The weather during this period was cold and rainy, and the groundwas muddy. As we spent a lot of time in the fox holes, our boots andfeet stayed cold and wet with little opportunity to warm and drythem. This caused some of our guys to get trench foot, and they hadto be sent to the rear for treatment. The more that went to the rearthe more time the rest of us had to spend in the fox holes. Adegenerating situation.</P><P>Another GI and I were in a fox hole near the pill box one morningwhen one of our tanks rumbled up from behind us. Concealed from theenemy by the hill, it came to a stop about 20 yards from our hole,fired off three or four rounds at the German lines and then hightailed it out of the area. Nothing draws artillery and mortar firelike the presence of a tank, And sure enough half a dozen shells camewhistling over our little ole fox hole trying to hit the tank, whichwas by then safely out of harms way. Fortunately the rounds were highand we suffered no harm, just scaring us to death. That was mybaptism of fire.</P><P>A couple of days later, five other GI's and I were manning the twoobservation posts near the edge of the woods. Two of us in one ofthem and three in the other about ten yards away. About noon I wasstanding watch in our hole with just my head showing, and eating acan of C-Rations. Everything had been quiet when suddenly a mortarshell burst about 20 feet from our hole. The concussion blew my handand ration can into my face and knocking off my glasses. I droppeddown in the hole, put on my glasses and ducked under the covered partof the hole. Half a dozen rounds came in close but not as close asthe first one.</P><P>Suddenly it was quiet again, but when I got on the phone toreport, I heard small arms fire behind our holes. I reported thisalso and I was told to have everybody take cover since our artillerywas going to fire on our positions to drive off the attackers. Thiswas done to my dismay, and after ten minutes or so, all was quietagain. I peeked out of my hole and saw no Crypts; so I attempted tocall in again but the phone was dead. The line had apparently beencut by the barrage. I ran over to the other hole and couldn't see asoul. I hollered in and got no answer. I figured they must have beentaken prisoner. What to do? Since it was needed to get word back tothe C.O. about our situation, I told my buddy I was going back toreport and would repair the phone line on the way.</P><P>I spliced about a half dozen breaks in the line on the way,crossed the minefield, and reported to the C.O. that we had three mentaken prisoner. About a half hour later the three guys came walkingin. They had been hiding under a blanket in their hole when I lookedin and hadn't answered my call. They thought I was a German (I don'teven speak the language). Not too long after that when I was gettingsome hot chow, someone noticed that I had shrapnel hole through thecollar of my jacket about an inch from my neck. It must have beencaused by the first shell burst. I lucked out that time.</P><P>In retrospect it appears that the enemy knew where the observationpost fox holes were and had laid on their barrage to keep us down andallow an infantry patrol to wipe us out or take us prisoners.</P><P>After a week at the pill box we got orders to go on the attack. Wemoved forward and through the woods with no opposition at first. Butat the time we got out of the woods onto open ground, the Jerriesopened up with machine gun, rifle and mortar fire from another woodsacross the field 200 yards or so away. My ammo carrier and I (anothergreen replacement) dug in near the edge of the woods. His proved tobe a good location as we had good visibility, and as we were a littleout of the woods we didn't have to worry about tree bursts duringbombardments. The enemy fire kept us pinned down all that afternoonand night</P><P>During the night I heard what sounded like a GI calling out forhelp from out in the open field. He said he had been wounded andwanted someone to help him get back to the rear. He sounded patheticand I wanted to help him. We had been warned that the Germans usedrecordings like that to get sympathetic GI's to venture into boobytrapped areas in an attempt to help wounded comrades. After about 20minutes the calls stopped. But I still wonder if it was for real.<BR>By the next morning we hadn't had any contact with any of the rest ofthe group, so I crawled to the fox holes of some of the other guysand they were all empty. They had obviously pulled back during thenight and hadn't let us know, leaving the two of us out there in noman's land by ourselves.</P><P>We spent the day in our holes by ourselves without incident and atdusk decided to pullback ourselves. The problem was that we didn'tknow where our company had gone.</P><P>I had never seen a darker night in my life. My buddy and I gropedour way through the woods with artillery fire hitting around us. Webumping into trees and limbs and falling into foxholes for whatseemed like hours. What's more, we weren't sure in which direction wewere headed as we couldn't see the stars.</P><P>After a while and fearful of being shot at by not only Germans,but by our own troops as well. We decided to stay put until daylight.In the early morning we heard voices and moving for a look, we sawabout a dozen of our guys carrying chow. What a relief! We joinedthem as they were headed to our company with hot food.</P><P>The first thing I did when we got back to our squad was to raisehell with my squad leader for pulling back without letting us knowabout it. His excuse was that he couldn't find our fox hole in thedark.</P><P>One rainy night in early December we pushed off to attack a Germanoccupied factory about a mile away on the out skirts of Lamersdorf.The night was so dark, it was decided we would attack with unloadedrifles, fixed bayonets and hand grenades. During our approach, some20mm aircraft guns were firing at enemy positions from high groundbehind us.</P><P>Because of the rain and darkness it was difficult for us to stayorganized and I soon lost site of the rest of my squad; but I couldhear them up ahead. Someone ahead of me took a prisoner and passedhim back to me. I didn't want to get separated from the squad, so Imotioned him to keep going to the rear with his hands up. When we gotclose to the factory the German artillery opened up on us.</P><P>I was in a railroad switching yard at the time so I scooted undera box car for protection. Shells kept coming into the factory forhours it seemed. So I just stayed put until daylight. When theshelling let up, I went into the factory where I located the rest ofthe squad.</P><P>Our squad spent a couple of days there with others to rest, dryout, and warm up. The factory was used to make charcoal bricks out ofpowdered coal. A couple of amusing things happened here, In anattempt to get warm and dry out, some of the guys started fires onthe factory's concrete floor. As most of the windows had been shotout, the wind blew sparks around the room. Some of the sparks foundtheir way to a bag of bazooka ammo. Somehow, their propellants wereignited and they took around the place like Roman candles, and hadeveryone ducking for cover. Since the safety pins were still in theydid not explode and no one got hurt.</P><P>There was a row of a half dozen houses about 100 yards from thefactory. Sgt. Conally kept looking at the houses. His sixth sensethere was somebody in them, so he took a couple of the guys andflushed out half a dozen Jerries who were more than glad tosurrender.</P><P>John Rutledge and I located a boxed up German bazooka in thefactory, and as things were getting a little boring, we decided toamuse ourselves by seeing if we could figure out the German languageinstructions and fire it. When we thought we knew how it worked, wetook it outside and fired it at a railroad car. The bazooka shelltook off with a mighty roar and hit the target but did not explode onimpact. Other than that it was a great diversion.</P><P>I don't remember where or when, but two other GI's and I weremanning a road block one morning when a jeep drove up with two MP'sin the front seat and two German POW's in the back seat. We stoppedthem and the driver said they were transporting the prisoners to therear for interrogation. As they had been away from their unit theyhad not received the pass word for the day. Everything looked O.K. tome so I gave them the pass word and sent them on their way. The nextday I heard a report that the Germans had been infiltrating our linesby sending jeeps with English speaking in captured MP uniforms andtwo German soldiers in the back seat. The report directed all roadblocks to be on the look out for them and take them prisoners. Thatwas my biggest goof-up of the war.</P><P>By mid December the push into Germany bogged down due to the cold,wet miserable weather and mud. As combat action in our Eschweillerarea was at a standstill, the powers that be decided that some of thetroops on the line could be spared for some R &amp; R (Rest andRecreation) in a rear area for a week. I had been in active combatfor a bout two months without a change in clothes, a bath, or adecent night's sleep. (combat troops grab sleep when ever and whereever they can.)</P><P>Some of the other guys and I from Co. G were loaded into trucks onDec. 15 and traveled to a small town about two hours drive away. Somebuildings had been made into barracks and we had a hot shower andwere issued new clothing. That evening after a hot meal we exploredaround town for awhile, then returned to the barracks for a goodnight's sleep and plan for the recreation for the rest of theweek.</P><P>Our plans were changed in a hurry. We were awakened at sunrise andtold to pack our gear and get ready to return to our outfits becausethe German army had started a major counter attack. It was laterreferred to as, "The Battle of the Bulge". When we got back toEschweiller we found that the break through was south of our area andwe were to only to hold on to our position. At least I got I got someclean clothes and a good night's sleep out of my short R &amp; R.</P><P>During the Battle of the Bulge we billeted in a deserted Germanhome on the edge of the small town, Merken, near the Roer river. Wehad hot meals at the company kitchen most of the time, supplementingour diets with canned food we found in the basement. The civilianshad turned loose their rabbits and other animals when they evacuated.I remember seeing the rabbits running about in the snow out in thefields.</P><P>Don Streicker found a cow somewhere, and kept it a barn behind ourquarters. He would milk it regularly, so we had plenty of fresh milk.I was watching him milk on e day when the cow kicked over the thebucket. Don got mad and gave the cow a whack with the bucket. Afterseveral weeks Don decided he would rather have fresh meat than milk,so he killed and butchered the cow. As the weather was cold, the cowhung in the barn frozen and we would cut off some steaks whenever wewanted them. The word spread fast throughout the the company, so itwasn't long before the cow had been completely consumed.</P><P>A regular occurrence while we were holding position was a smallGerman airplane that would come around every evening and drop a fewbombs at random around our area. He didn't do much damage, but kepteveryone uneasy. We called him "Bed Check Charlie".</P><P>Don Streicker and I had an argument going for some time as towhich was more accurate, the M-1 rifle or the BAR (Browning AutomaticRifle). To settle it, we went out into an open area and set up sometargets. After shooting for a short time we heard an unusual soundthat proved to be a German jet plane (the first jet we had seen). Aswe watched it fly toward us, we noticed a second object falling belowit. We decided it was a bomb and scurried for cover in a ditch. Thebomb exploded about a half mile or so from us. At that point we lostinterest in settling our argument and just got out of there.</P><P>A few days before we were to go on the offensive again across theRoer river, Lt. Turner was ordered to get up a patrol to check outthe water level of the Roer river, which had been flooded by theGermans to block our advance. When I was picked as one of the patrolmembers, I told Lt. Turner that I would be glad to go, but my glasseshad been broken a couple of days before and I hadn't gotten myreplacements yet. He told me it would be a night patrol and therewouldn't be much to see anyhow.</P><P>We had a 12 man patrol dressed in white camouflaged outfits, so wewould be difficult to see in the snow covered landscape. We left ourhouse in Merken and followed a fence abut a quarter of a mile to theriver bank. Lt. Turner positioned me with my BAR on top of the bankto cover their movement to the water and back. It was so dark Icouldn't see them after they got more than 20 feet from me. I musthave been there about 20 minutes trying to listen for enemy activitywhen I heard a strange sound like someone dragging something acrossthe frozen ground, and coming toward me. I aimed My BAR&nbsp;at theapproaching sound ready to fire when I heard Lt. Turner say, "It's OKMac,it's us". I breathed a sigh of relief and put the BAR&nbsp;safetycatch on, and followed the squad back to our house in Merken. Thesound I heard was the of the frozen snow capes dragging on theground. Some of the guys had gone out into the water to check thewater depth. It was a wonder they didn't freeze to death before wegot back to the house.</P><P>In late January, I mailed a letter to my brother, David, who wasserving in the Airforce in China. The letter was returned to me inearly February with the word, "Missing", written on the envelope.Later correspondence from my parents revealed that David was beingrotated back to the states after two and a half years overseas, andthe plane that was flying him out of China had gotten off course andcrashed in the Himalayan mountains. All on board except one, mybrother, had been killed (February 4th).</P><P>When the German's last counter offensive had been contained andpushed back to its starting line, the 104th Division was ordered togo on the offensive again. After dark on February 22nd the Corps ofEngineers brought a large number of wooden boats up to the frontlines to used to cross the Roer river. Each boat was large enough tocarry about six men and their gear. After brief instructions on howto launch, paddle, and disembark the boats, we carried them about aquarter of a mile to the river and put them in the water about 5:00A.M. It was very dark and you couldn't see the other bank. This wasto our advantage because the Jerries couldn't see us either. Wepaddled across the river (about 50 yards) as quietly as we could, aswe were very exposed to enemy fire. Fortunately our boat was notdetected, but some of the other boats received machine gun and riflefire.</P><P>When we got close to shore , I got out into knee deep water andheaded for shore. I had on knee high boots which got filled withwater and felt like they weighed 50 pounds each. I decided I couldn'tdo much fighting with them on, so I took them off, drained them andput them back on. Meanwhile the rest of the squad had moved up thebank to attack the small village. It was about daylight and I triedto catch up with them. In the dim light I got tangled up in somebarbed wire trying to cross it. It seemed the harder I tried to getfree the more tangled I became. I was afraid some Jerry would spot mein that mess, but I finally got free and caught up with the squad atthe edge of town.</P><P>There were still German soldiers in this town. Our guys had notbeen detected by the time we got into town, so we started clearinghouses. I remember some of our troops on the other side of the rowhouses throwing phosphorous grenades over the roof into the street wewere on. Fortunately no on e was hurt. When we got to the end of therow houses, we found several Germans in the basement of the endhouse. They surrendered without a fight. Later a couple of guys and Iwent up to the second floor to look around and spotted a dug inmortars emplacement firing towards our company command post. We aimedour weapons and when they were standing with their heads exposed weopened up. That silenced the mortar fire.</P><P>Having secured the town by noon, we ate and rested up for a nightattack on the next town. After dark we were getting organized for ourattack when the Jerries started an artillery barrage on the town. Wequietly dispersed into shelter and it was decided we would not attackuntil dawn. We started out over a sugar beet field toward the nexttown which appeared to be about three miles away. Our artillery hadbeen firing at it, but we had no return fire. When we got about halfway across the field the Jerries opened up with small arms fire andpinned us down. Some of the guys ducked into bomb craters, but I onlyhad a sugar beet plant to hide behind (not much protection). We werepinned down for about an hour while our artillery worked the townover.</P><P>I heard a couple of bullets fly over, and then one hit me in theleft shoulder. It felt like getting hit with a stick. It wasn'tpainful, just numb. Shortly after I was hit, one of our artilleryshells hit a barn on the near edge of town, which ended the sniperfire in my direction. If the Germans had used mortar or artilleryfire on our position they would have chewed us up. As it was Lt.Turner, our platoon leader was killed with a bullet in the head.Another GI was also wounded at about the same time I was hit.</P><P>I couldn't do much after I got hit except to wait for the shootingto let up and get some medical attention. I just laid there for abouta half an hour watching the artillery pound it. When our guys startedmoving into the town, I got up and headed back to the rear. I wasdirected to an aid station and given first aid before being put on anamphibious "duck" to back across the Roer river with several otherwounded GI's. I hated to leave my squad but I wouldn't be of much usewith only one working arm. The date was February 24,1945 at 10:00 amwhen I got hit. I had been up front for about 4 months at thattime.</P><P>I was transported back to a Paris military hospital for surgery.The bullet had hit the top of my left shoulder, went through a smallhole in the shoulder bone, passed under my shoulder blade and cameout below it. Surgery involved cleaning the wound and enlarging theexit so it could be packed with gauze to encourage healing from theinside out.</P><P>The hospital was full of soldiers from all nationalities even aRussian who liked to play chess. One day an Orderly came running intoour ward yelling for help. It seems that a battle fatigue case on thetop floor was trying to jump out a window. As most combat veteransdon't have much respect for a battle fatigue guy, the only offer theorderly got was a couple of guys who offered to go up and open thewindow.</P><P>After a couple of weeks in the hospital I was well enough to getsome one day passes into Paris. I remember taking a tour of the citywith a bunch of soldiers and just walking around. One day I waswalking across a bridge over the Seine river downtown, when I met ahigh school class mate, Bill Kast. He was stationed in Paris with amap making outfit and knew the city well. We got together severaltimes after that and visited, via subway, some of the sights of thecity, a steeple chase, etc.</P><P>After about two months in the hospital, I was considered capableof combat again. So I was sent back to my old outfit at the frontlines. By this time most of the combat was over and the German armywas pretty much "Kaput". One thing I remember on the trip to Dobernfrom Paris, where my squad was located, was crossing the Rhine riverat the Remagen bridge. We actually crossed the river on a pontoonbridge that had been built by our engineers just north of the bridge.We finally arrived at Dobern where I joined my old comrades-in-arms,or what was left of them.</P><P>After a few days we were trucked to Brandis where we were in closecontact with the Russians. Our job here was to keep peace in a GermanPOW&nbsp;work camp that contained people of many nationalities. Theywere all eager to leave the place and go home, but had to wait fortransportation. There was not too much trouble in the camp. However,I heard that a few of the inmates one night had beat up the formercamp officer, stole his goat and left the camp. They all deniedknowing anything about it., but I noticed some of them cooking a goatthe next day.</P><P>I almost started WWIII in our next town, Dessau. I saw a Russiansoldier walk up to an elderly women on a bicycle, snatch it out fromunder her, dumping her to the ground, and ride off on it. My firstinstinct was to shoot the SOB, but then thought the better of it.Since active combat was over, the army was getting back to garrisonroutine again with close order drill, physical conditioning, marchesand inspections. I sent home for Dad's hair clippers and became thebarber of those willing to risk their lives one more time.</P><P>It was decided by the powers that be that the 104th Division wasto deploy to the Pacific Theater to participate in the invasion ofJapan. The division was brought up to full strength. Wounded or sickveterans who had recovered were returned along with greenreplacements. In due time the division was moved to Le Havre, France,and put aboard the good ship, " John Erickson". About July 3rd, wesailed for New York, arriving July 11th. From there we were given amonth's furlough before reassembling at Camp San Luis Obispo,California for shipment to the Pacific Theater. Fortunately PresidentTruman authorized dropping atomic bombs on Japan while we were onfurlough, and that ended the war and our planned deployment to thePacific Theater.</P><P>While awaiting discharge from the army, I spent short periods oftime at Camp Knight near Oakland California, where we were givenliberty to take civilian employment. I got a job in a nut processingplant. From there I went to Fort Louis near Tacoma Washington, whereI guided other veterans through the discharge procedure until I wasdischarged on January 7th, 1946.</P><P><A HREF="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</A></P></BODY></HTML>
