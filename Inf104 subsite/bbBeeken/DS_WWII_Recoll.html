I guess it was partly because I never much talkedabout the war and after years forgot many of the details.</p><p>In Minneapolis, John Rutledge asked me if we were in the samesquad and I couldn't remember either. I remembered the diary I keptand told John I would try to find it. Well, as you can see the diarywas found. Most of the original diary was lost in battle. After thefighting was over and I was still alive, I wished I had taken bettercare of it. On the boat ride home I rewrote as much of it as I couldremember but some of the fine details were already becoming fuzzy,like the names of towns and the exact day-to-day operations. Now someof the papers were missing again, lost over the years. I hadn't readit since it was written over 50 years ago. I guess with me, when thewar was over it was over. Now I decided to rewrite the diary and sendit to a few friends because their names appeared in it. What a taskthat became. Originally written on scraps of paper, the words were sosmall a magnifying glass was used extensively. Then my daughter, Pat,spent hours typing it on her computer.</p><p>The text is unaltered from the original except that a fewsentences were omitted. It seems I was very critical of how a fewpeople acted under pressure of combat. It's something I wouldn't feelcomfortable having others read now. Whoever are the few people that Isend this to can rest assured the dropped sentences do not concernthem.</p><p>My other concern is if anyone is even interested in this verypersonal account of my combat experience. It might be pretty boringsome of the time to anyone who hasn't lived it. Please feel free tocast it aside; it's not required reading!</p><p>One advantage of this writing is the accuracy. Since it waswritten once and never repeated over the years there was no chancefor changes to embellish the stories and make them more interesting.It sure was tempting to change things to make me look more like abrave hero instead of a bumbling, scared kid. But then it wouldn't betrue and there's no fun living a lie.</p><p>Maybe you won't agree with some of the details but that's thewayI saw the war.</p><center><table border="0" width="77%">  <tbody>    <tr>      <td>      <p>Sample copy of the original:</p>      </td>      <td>      <p>This was written on the back of an envelope:</p>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>      <center><a href="images/Sample.jpeg"><img style="border: 0px solid ;" alt="Thumbnail of diary page." src="images/Sample.thm.jpeg" x-claris-useimagewidth="" x-claris-useimageheight=""></a></center>      </td>      <td>      <center><a href="images/Envel.jpeg"><img style="border: 0px solid ;" alt="Thumbnail of envelope." src="images/Envel.thm.jpeg" x-claris-useimagewidth="" x-claris-useimageheight=""></a></center>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td>      <p></p>      </td>      <td>      <p>It must have been the members of our squad at one time.</p>      </td>    </tr>  </tbody></table></center><p>Map of Germany with some of the cities undelined that arementioned in the text.</p><p align="right"><i>Not Provided. -ed</i></p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Forward"></a>Forward:</h3><p>For the next few months this diary will be very incomplete forthese are the months that I spent in combat. At first, while we werein divisional reserve, I kept my day-to-day diary but that was givenup and the diary lost. In the first place there wasn't time to writewhile chasing Jerries, and secondly I didn't expect to live longenough so that the diary would be of any use to me.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h3><a name="Diary"></a>Diary:</h3><p>We left the rear assembly point somewhere in Belgium north ofBrussels and went by truck towards the front lines. Our battalion wasin reserve so we rode almost to the place where we dug in. Judging bythe sound of exploding artillery shells I would say we were aboutfour miles behind the lines. Still our CO, Captain Craig, had us eachday dig a fox hole and a covered slit trench six feet deep to sleepin. That was his first crazy mistake in combat. The guard was rough.Fifty percent of the men were on at a time, and when the CO heardthat someone captured a Jerry he increased the guard to seventy-fivepercent. That man never did know what the score was.</p><p>After spending half the night with very little sleep and halffreezing to death, we moved forward the next afternoon to an areasome 1000 yards closer. But here I think I should stop and tell aboutour squad.</p><p>With a few exceptions we had a darn good squad. Jack Allen, aboyof 19 and one of my best friends, was squad leader with Bill Thompsonthe assistant squad leader. The two scouts were Michael Roy and DonMichael. Roy is a full-blooded Indian from Arizona. The BAR teamconsisted of Jenkins, Berg, and Maxwell, and the riflemen wereDemopulos, Elliot, Krupinek, Sloan, Jenkins, and myself. Followingthis squad as it went through the first months of combat should beinteresting.</p><p>Well, after we moved forward our squad was pulled back toguardthe battalion CP. We were placed in a field, guarding a road. Thatnight we slept very little. Before daylight the company moved forwardagain and we dug in an open field. When the sun came up it becamequite warm and most of us slept.</p><p>Our platoon sergeant became ill and after the platoon wasreshuffled our squad was missing its first scout. Roy becameassistant squad leader of another squad. Demopulos took Roy's placeas scout.</p><p>During the day we hiked back a ways, got in trucks, and weredriven about ten miles around to the right flank of the division.There was a gap between the 104th Division and the lines on the rightso our battalion was supposed to fill it in. At this time we werestill in Belgium very close to the Holland border. After we detruckedwe marched a long ways to an area where we again dug in. It was darkthen and before I had time to lay down I was called out on my firstpatrol; this was the first of many more to come. Thompson was incharge of the four of us. One of the other boys was Michael but Ican't remember the other one. We went out to where we thought we weresupposed to but we never did come to the right place. All I canremember is crossing one barbed wire fence after another. We musthave crossed 20 of them. Once we saw something moving in the distanceand almost jumped out of our skins until it gave out a low moo. Afterwe came back we slept a little and then it was daylight. Our platoonmoved to a slightly different position and dug in again. A buzz bombcame putting overhead and then cut off. We dove for our holes becausewe thought it was going to land on us but it hit a few milesaway.</p><p>During this time we were living almost entirely on C-rations.Thekitchen didn't know what the score was and didn't get the food to us.Many a meal they threw away. When we became hungry and our rationswere gone we went to the nearest field and grabbed a turnip. Aboutevery field was planted in these sweet turnips and they werelifesavers.</p><p>About noon G Company pulled out to clear an area; 3rd Platoonwasin the lead. I was part of a flank guard that searched houses. But wedidn't find a single Jerry. They had all pulled out a few daysbefore. The people were all glad to see us come. One fellow couldspeak fairly good English. He approached us and said "Welcome, wethank you for liberating us." We took him to the CO forquestioning.</p><p>The company stopped here and sent out a patrol on ahead. Thepatrol didn't find a thing. One of the members of the patrol wantedto see how his rifle worked so he fired a shot. The CO got the wholedarn company ready for an attack thinking it was a Jerry firing. Boy,we were really green then. When we found out what the shot was aboutwe got straightened out and dug in. When night came I was sent with agroup on a listening post. It was a rainy, windy, cold night. Up tothen it was the most miserable night I spent. After midnight it gottoo much for us so the sergeant in charge went back to see if hecould pull us in. We all went in but two. So we went back to ourholes where we continued to freeze the rest of the night. I duganother hole just to keep warm.</p><p>When daylight came we again moved out, this time back towardswhere we came, but instead of riding in trucks we walked. Yes, wewalked and walked until we couldn't feel our feet anymore. Finallytowards evening, we came to our assembly point.</p><p>We were releaving the 3rd Battalion. They were fighting whilewewere messing around back in reserve. When we asked them how it wasthey said it was rough. We were all plenty scared. We walked andwalked some more. No one seemed to know exactly where we were goingor what we were doing. I can still remember that night. The moonshone beautifully down on quietly marching troops. Then out of thestill of the night we heard a whistle overhead. I think I was thefirst one to hit the ditch beside the road. That was our firstintroduction to the German 88. The shell landed behind us and hit thecompany following us. After a few shells landed everything becamequiet again and we started marching once more. But soon more shellscame in and we hit the gutter again. This kept up for some time untilthe whole battalion became mixed up. Our CO came along and told Jack(Allen) to take his squad back a ways to guard a cross road.</p><p>As soon as we got there someone came pedaling down on abicycle.He almost ran into us so we grabbed him. He proved to be a Germansoldier, the first I had seen. He was as much confused as we were.Apparently he didn't figure we had penetrated that far into theirlines. It was then that I first realized that we were a spearheadinto enemy territory.</p><p>A couple of men guarded our prisoner while the rest of usspreadout to guard all directions. Soon a motorcycle came buzzing down theroad. We still didn't know what the score was. Someone yelled haltand the motorcycle slowed down. We jumped out of our hiding placesand pulled the man off the motorcycle who proved to be anotherconfused Jerry. We went back once more to our hideouts. I was withThompson. As I lay there on the cold ground, I began to realize thatat last I was in actual combat and that men could be killed. It wasone of the most unusual feelings I have ever had.</p><p>Thompson and I waited there for about 15 minutes and then wentback to see what was going on. We were halted by a GI. After somefast talking we proved that our squad had been replaced by anotherone and Thompson and I had been forgotten about. We took off down theroad where our column went and amazingly enough found our squad.Everyone was still confused. No one seemed to know where they weresupposed to be. I was walking behind someone and before I knew it Ihad lost the rest of the squad. I asked around to find out what wasup and who was who. I was tangled up in the 3rd Battalion, the 2ndwas a mile up the road. Another boy was also looking for the 2nd sowe went on ahead together.</p><p>After we had gone for awhile we wondered if it was a wiseidea. Wewere all alone walking down that dark street,</p><p>Suddenly we heard some noise ahead. It sounded like someonewasdoing something with a team of horses and wagon. The voices didn'tsound American. This other boy and I turned off the road and waitedby the side of a building. We were both too afraid to go further.</p><p>Then someone yelled halt, followed by two shots and theneverything was quiet again. We waited.</p><p>Finally the 3rd Battalion caught up to us. We told them whathadhappened. Some of us went ahead to see what we could find. We found ateam of horses and wagon as we had figured. I believe the wagon mayhave been loaded with German mines and someone was trying to lay aroad block but was scared away.</p><p>The convoy stopped again so I started out in another attempttolocate the 2nd Battalion. Believe me this time I really was scared. Iwas all alone, anyone hiding along the way could have knocked me off.Ahead of me I heard someone groaning and then saw someone lyingbeside the road. I went to him and saw that he was bandaged up. Icouldn't get him to say anything understandable. Then I heard someonecoming down the street. I quickly ducked behind a nearby building. Asthey came along they proved to be two GI's and a prisoner. I showedmyself and asked them what the score was. They said the wounded manlying down was a civilian. They asked me if I would take theirprisoner back to the 3rd Battalion. I said OK and took off with himdown the road. When we reached the 3rd Battalion I handed theprisoner over to some guards. This time I had enough and stayed put.I decided to stay with some friendly troops for a change.</p><p>We waited there for some time for orders to move up. I wassittingbeside a truck when a shell whistled overhead. Everyone made a madscramble for the ditches beside the road. More shells came in andeveryone started digging madly. Fortunately the shell didn't land onus or there certainly would have been mass murder to say theleast.</p><p>After awhile the convoy moved out and about 12 of us remainedinthe ditch still digging in. The ones that remained were probably alllost like myself.</p><p>Soon daylight began to break. Our tanks rolled up the road andparked in a field ahead of us. One of our group said, "Let's get outof here." I guess he was afraid of a tank battle. He ran in onedirection and soon someone else followed him until just abouteveryone was gone. I decided I better do something also so I jumpedon a jeep that was heading up front. The jeep stopped and I got offand asked different GIs where G Company was. No one knew. When moreshells started coming in I rushed to an open field where other GIswere and dug in. More shells came in. One hit 10 yards from me andshowered dirt all over me. But I wasn't worried a bit. I even jokedabout the close hits to another fellow but he didn't think I was veryfunny.</p><p>I found out I was in E Company area and G Company was to theleftso when the shelling eased for awhile I started out to find it.</p><p>The boys were quite glad to see me. They couldn't figure outwhathad happened to me. They also had some close calls. They had quite ashelling. I got in a foxhole beside Demopulos. More shells came inand we sweated them out. Yes, we sweated them out like never beforeor after. Apparently the Jerries had good observation on us and theypoured shells in all the rest of the day and all night.</p><p>One shell hit in front of my hole a few yards. Another hitonlyseven feet to the rear. A large artillery shell also landed fairlyclose. I didn't know if I was shivering because I was cold or becauseI was afraid. It must have been a combination of both.</p><p>One man, Sgt. Graziano, a squad leader in another platoon waskilled by shrapnel when a shell exploded as he tried to get back inhis hole. That was my first experience with death. As they carriedhim away in a blanket it was hard to realize that he would no longermove again.</p><p>Patrols were sent out but I wasn't picked for any. One patrolraninto a tank and it fired point blank at them. One boy just about hadhis legs blown off. The patrol took off except one man who stayed andtook care of the wounded one. This one fellow was later up for acommission but was cheated out of it when he went back for good withtrench foot.</p><p>The next day all shelling ceased. The enemy apparently pulledback. Our company assembled and we pushed off down the road clearinghouses as we went. The Hollanders came out to greet us and gave usthe only food they seemed to have-apples. We took all we could carry.We were very hungry.</p><p>I was stuck out on the right flank patrol with Demopulos,Sloan,and Krupanick. I was out about 200 yards from the main body walkingdown the road. It was tough work keeping up.</p><p>We were supposed to kill all dogs. Someone in the main bodyspotted a dog out to the right flank and fired. Soon more fellowsstarted firing and the bullets were hitting near me so I hit theground and then ran to a house.</p><p>Soon we came to a good-sized town and our flank patrol waspulled.At this time I just can't remember the name of that town. Anyways,the town was not defended and we entered it without a fight. Everyonecame out to greet us. They gave us apples, cookies, and coffee. Agroup of girls dressed in red, white, and blue uniforms wanderedaround and kissed unsuspecting GIs. When they came near me, I walkedacross the street and everyone laughed. We waited in the town maybean hour. I think they were trying to find out what to do next.</p><p>This was the first time for a long time that any of us reallylaughed and appeared to be happy. Temporarily our minds were takenfrom the war. All the civilians were very thankful to us. One thing Iguess I will always remember is seeing a Catholic priest in a churchwindow smiling and holding a paper against a window. It had theseletters on it-I.O.U. These 3 letters expressed his thanks better thananything else could.</p><p>It was at this time that I remarked to Sloan, "It sure isgreat tobe alive." He must have been thinking along the same line. "It sureis old buddy," he said. A couple of months later when we were inGermany I remembered these words very distinctly.</p><p>Then with no warning a shell whistled and exploded somewhere.Everyone ran for cover in houses, doorways, and cellars. All our funended abruptly and we were fighting a war again. That shell gotsomeone on the ball and the column started moving out of town to anopen field. It was already dark as we started digging in. The groundwas very wet and it was beginning to rain. Demop and I dug a holetogether; it was a horrible mess. In the bottom was six inches ofwater and mud. We were plastered with water and mud from head totoes. And then the enemy started slinging in 88s but lucky for usthey hit a few hundred yards in front of us.</p><p>A ten-man German patrol came to our lines and was captured bytheoutpost after one Jerry was killed. Demop went to help take theprisoners back so I was left alone.</p><p>I hadn't slept in so many days and nights that I couldn'tcountthem anymore. I was wet, cold, tired, and scared. I don't think I wasever so miserable in my life. It was pouring rain and I was standingin six inches of mud and water. A few times I caught myself in a sortof unconscious stupor. I "awoke" when shells came in and exploded nottoo far away.</p><p>I figured it was only about midnight and I wondered how Icouldlast until morning. There were a few houses 300 yards to our rear andI knew there would be civilian air-raid shelters near. I got up andwalked to the houses. I found a shelter and crawled in. There werecivilians in it. There was room for me near the entrance and it wasreasonable dry so I just lay down and fell asleep immediately.</p><p>The next thing I knew a girl was shaking me and motioning metocome out of the shelter. I was very stiff and cold and could hardlywalk. The girl saw what shape I was in and held on to me until wereached the house and went into the living room.</p><p>If I remember right, there was a mother and father, this girlthatbrought me in, and a younger girl. There was a stove in the room.They helped me take off my raincoat and jacket and had me sit by thestove. Then they brought me some pork ribs, bread and butter, and hotmilk. And did I eat!</p><p>The girl that brought me in was about 20 years old and verypretty. We couldn't talk together of course so I wrote a short notethanking them for what they did and telling them to write to mesomeday after the war.</p><p>I must have been in the house an hour and I knew I had to go.Itwas already beginning to get light. A tanker (a soldier that drives atank) came in the house and I left. I thawed out and my clothes werehalfway dry. I felt very good. I don't know how I could have livedthrough that night if it hadn't been for those wonderful, kindDutchmen.</p><p>I went back to my hole; it was half full of water. The otherfellows were just starting to walk around. No one missed me so Ididn't say a word to anyone. We were told to clean our rifles as bestwe could. Most of the rifles were packed with mud and the operatinghandles could not be drawn back. I finally got my rifle to work sortof halfheartedly. Shortly we formed and pushed off in the attack, the1st Platoon leading, our platoon to the left. We were advancingtoward the Mark(?) River I learned later. But when we advanced a fewhundred yards, word came over the radio to pull back. We did thatwith no hesitation. Had we gone through with that attack there wouldprobably be very few of us alive today.</p><p>The 1st Battalion did cross the river and was just aboutannihilated. The enemy blasted them with direct fire fromself-propelled guns. They fired right into individual foxholes. Wemet some of the boys coming back down a road. They said theircommanding officer told them to take off. These fellows had swum backacross the river. The rest stayed on the other side for three daysuntil relief came. Our company reformed and we marched back throughthe town and then out on the other side. We were given rations forthe first time in a long time. We stopped at a couple of houses anddug in an open field. It was already twilight. Demopulos had joinedus a few hours earlier so we dug in together. When we had just aboutcompleted digging I walked a short ways over to a straw pile to getsomething soft for the bottom of the foxhole. All of a sudden therewas a deafening explosion and large slabs of dirt were thrown allover the place. I heard men crying in pain and yelling for the aidman.</p><p>I went back to our hole. The shell hit only about 30 feet fromDemop. We figured it to be a short 155 that our troops were firingover our heads. Shrapnel had hit one man in the 3rd Squad, Carlson,and two men in our squad, Elliot and Michael. Elliot and Carlson werehit pretty bad and never did return to our outfit; they were lucky.Michael was hit with a small piece of shrapnel in the arm. He wasstanding about 60 feet from the shell burst. Demop probably wasn'thit because he was in the hole digging. I took that walk to the strawpile just in time. Demop and I were both very scared. Demop asked Lt.Turner if we could go to a civilian dugout a hundred yards behind andhe said OK.</p><p>It was a fairly large dugout so we had room to lay down on thestraw floor. I was all for sleeping but Demop insisted that one of usstand guard so we took turns an hour at a time. At about one o'clockThompson came and got us. Our squad had to go on a patrol. The merethought of a patrol scared the heck out of us but there wasn't muchanyone could do about it. We all griped but it did no good.</p><p>A combat patrol of 60 men led by Lt. Mauldin was to cross theMarkRiver with the purpose of capturing a prisoner for information. Ourpatrol was to follow the combat patrol until it reached a dyke beforethe river, then follow the dyke to a road and make a circle and comeback.</p><p>When we reached the dyke we could not walk behind it becausetheground was flooded so we had to walk on the side of it until wereached a road. GIs were dug in the side of the dyke and seemed to behaving a pretty tough time of it.</p><p>Going down the road we saw something moving to our left front.Westopped and squatted down, but soon we saw that it was only cows.Eventually we came back to the same road we came out on and met thecombat patrol coming back. We had heard a tremendous amount of smallarms fire out there and we asked them what had happened. As far as Icould figure out they just opened up with everything they had andthen cleared out. But they did accomplish their mission; theycaptured a Jerry.</p><p>We followed the combat patrol back. When we were going acrosssomehigh ground about four 88s came in and didn't hit very far away. Theshrapnel was flying pretty close but no one was hit.</p><p>When we arrived back there was only a few hours untildaylight. Iwas all for sleeping because I was so tired, but Demopulos insistedon a guard. I slept on guard anyway. In the morning Lt. Turner gaveour squad permission to go in a nearby house to start a fire and dryourselves. That we did and it was really swell. It was the firsthouse we had been in for a long time and the first in combat. Thecivilians were still working the farms. They took care of theirlivestock and then went back behind the lines.</p><p>We stayed in the house all day eating rations and talking. Wenowhad a ten-man squad. None of us had very much sleep in the past fewdays but somehow no one was sleepy. Some mail came down to me. I gota few letters from home and from Chuck. Chuck was somewhere inFrance. Mom was getting worried about what I had been doing. Shestill didn't know I was in combat but was wondering. We were allowedto write one V-mail letter which I did.</p><p>Bulinsky from the 2nd Platoon came over to our house. Irememberhim saying, "It's too late in the war to be killed now." Every timein the future when someone was killed I would always remember that.Yes it was too late to be killed but there wasn't much anyone coulddo about it.</p><p>It was at this place that I finally got rid of some of myuneasiness. I thought it out for a long time and finally convincedmyself that it did no good to worry. The way I figured it there wasonly one way to look at combat. Either you would be wounded orkilled. If wounded a guy could get a pretty good break in a hospitaland if killed he doesn't know it anyway, so why worry? I tried to getDemop to see it that way but it was useless. Since his first day incombat he grew steadily worse. I guess what Ernie Pyle once said hitsthe nail on the head, "Most people aren't afraid to die, it is thatthey hate to give up the future." But Demop was an exception to therule. He was just plain worried all the time and refused to doanything about it. I worried about him.</p><p>During the day our platoon sargeant-Faringer-came back. Hestayedin the hole with Demop and me so we had an easy guard for thenight.</p><p>The next day we rested some more. We were getting ready for ariver crossing. Everyone seemed worried. My reasoning must havehelped me because I was no longer scared; I took a cheerful attitudetoward the whole thing. It was an attitude I kept all through combatand it was probably why I came through in one piece. I was eventhinking of the possibility of crossing the river without meetingresistance, but that was a little too much to hope for.</p><p>An hour before dark a few of us had to go over to H Companymortars and put up a security guard. Sloan and I stayed in one holeuntil dark. Then we went back to our company. The kitchen finallycaught up to us and we ate a hot meal. After that, every time we wenton a tough attack, the kitchen always gave us an exceptionally goodmeal. I always used to say they were fattening us before the kill. Itwas a poor joke though it was the awful truth.</p><p>About eight o'clock, just after dark set in, the companyorganizedand moved out. We moved out along a dyke and then stopped for aboutan hour. Some of the fellows started digging in. I didn't think wewould be there long so I just lay down and took it easy. When a fewshells whistled in, I wished I hadn't been so lazy, but then we movedout.</p><p>The boats were lined up behind the dyke. About 15 men wereassigned to each boat. Thompson and I were the only ones from oursquad in our boat.</p><p>The plan was that the 1st Platoon was to cross in the firstwaveand lay mines on certain roads and then maintain a road block. The3rd Platoon was to cross in the second wave. At a certain time the1st Platoon took off. The boats had to be carried about 500 yards tothe river across flat open land. Shortly after the 1st Platoon left,we followed. The boats were very heavy and had to be set downfrequently for rests. The 1st Platoon was carrying mines along withthe boats and were really having a tough time. Our boat caught up toone boat of the 1st Platoon so three of us helped them out,Varnadore, Owens, and myself.</p><p>We carried the boat to the river's edge and went back to ourownboat. We heard an enemy machine gun open up on the boat as it rowedacross. We couldn't find our boat when we went back. Varnadore wantedto dig in right there and wait for daylight. That seemed pretty dumbto me so I convinced him we should keep looking. We found Lt. Milnerand asked him if he knew where the boat was. He seemed to think theywere up ahead so we walked forward. We found them just as theyreached the river. Three boats were at the river's edge in this oneplace. Each boat was waiting for the other to go first. The engineerthat was the head of our boat finally got the boys to shove off. Thatis the only engineer I have seen with any guts. All the others wereso scared they were helpless. We waded the boat into the water andthen jumped in and rowed across. The river couldn't have been morethan 20 yards wide. At any second we expected an enemy machine gun toopen up on us, but none did. We landed and scrambled ashore. Theother boats soon followed.</p><p>Everyone was confused and didn't know where to go. Theybunched upsomething terrible. A few of us started digging in until someonestraightened things out. Shortly we moved out across a dyke and intoan open field where we dug in. The ground was very muddy. Before Ihad gone down very far I was digging in water. When I had dug downthree feet I quit and stood in six inches of water. My feet were socold they became numb and I could hardly feel them. Lt. Milner waslying in a slit trench about 20 yards to my rear. I heard him callJones (then cpl.) over. There was a lot of small arms fire to ourleft front and he wanted a patrol to go out and find out what wasgoing on. Jones went with four men but soon came back. He said therewere too many shells hitting in there and they couldn't get through.Lt. Milner wanted Jones to go back out but Jones wouldn't go.</p><p>At this time I was so miserable I didn't know what to doanymore.I went to Lt. Milner's hole and asked him if I could go out there bymyself. I figured one lone man had a pretty good chance of gettingthrough. At first Lt. Milner said, "No there are too many shellsfalling out there," but then after I stayed there awhile he said,"OK, go ahead. Say, what's your name?" I said, "Pvt. Svec" and tookoff.</p><p>I went across an open field and came to a canal. I followedthecanal down to a little bridge and crossed it. There was a house closeby and it sure looked spooky. I could imagine all kinds of snipers init. I went across more open fields and fences until I came to anothercanal. It was very dark so I didn't worry too much about being seen.The only way I could have crossed this canal was to wade it. That iswhat I started to do. The water was up to my waist and I was stillgoing down. Then a tracer bullet whizzed past me and I turned back.More shots were fired and I hugged the ground. I'll never know ifanyone saw me or not but the lead was coming too close. I went backthe same way because it was the only way to get back. I had to keephitting the ground, or more accurately mud, because the bullets werecoming too close.</p><p>When I approached our line someone said, "Halt!" I stopped andhesaid, "What's the password?" I said, "I don't know. I forgot, butdon't shoot I'm just another GI like you." He said, "What in hell areyou doing out there in no man's land?" I said, "It's a long story.Where is Lt. Milner?" When I found Lt. Milner I told him exactlywhere I was and what I saw. He said, "OK Svec, and now get back toyour hole." I did and froze the rest of the night. It was reallymiserable to say the least.</p><p>At dawn we moved out in the attack down the dyke parallel totheriver. From what we learned the rest of the company wasn't so luckyas our group. Snider, Cook, Smith, and others were dead. It was hardto believe. As we moved forward our artillery blasted the ground ahundred yards to our front. I was on the left side of the dyke. Wepassed many Jerry foxholes with Jerry rifles and equipment all overthe place. The boys on the other side of the dyke passed through thearea where the 1st Battalion was slaughtered when they made theirriver crossing three days before. They said dead GIs were all overthe place. Some had been killed with direct hits with 88s. I'm glad Ididn't see all of that. I saw one dead GI and that was enough. He waslying face down along the side of a building. It looked like a shellhit the building while he was crowded beside it. It was a peculiarfeeling that went through me as I looked at that dead man. No longercould he enjoy all the things he fought for, to do what he wantedwhen he wanted to, to go out with his girlfriend and have a goodtime, to drink beer and eat good food. I often wonder why I was somuch concerned about it at the time when at any second I could havebeen in his shoes. Maybe that is just the reason why, because I wasso near to being like him.</p><p>We held up here and dug in. There were so many shell cratersthatwe each picked a hole and enlarged it a little. In a couple of hourswe again moved off in the attack. Two other boys and myself had thejob to search out all houses ahead of the main body so that theywouldn't get caught in the open.</p><p>We cleared about ten houses and now we were doing them veryhastily so that the main body could keep advancing. But on theeleventh one we got a surprise. We opened a door and walked in on aJerry eating his supper. I don't know if he knew we were coming, buthe didn't seem very much surprised. He just got up and walked out thedoor and I followed while the other two searched the rooms. The boyslater told me they got a big kick out of that. The Jerry was prettybig and they said it sure looked funny as I trailed behind him.</p><p>As I brought the Jerry out we were between the scouts and themainbody. Then the Jerries in a house ahead started shooting at us withsmall arms and rifle grenades. My prisoner hit the ground as did I.We crawled back to relative safety.</p><p>Capt. Craig came up and searched the Jerry. A little later twomore Jerries were brought in. Varnadore and I took the three of themback, but after we had gone back quite a ways someone took my placeand I went up front again. By this time it was getting dark. I metSloan and another fellow and we crawled into a Jerry shelter. It wasjust large enough for the three of us.</p><p>Our platoon moved out and we didn't know it until later. Whenwefound out we decided to find them. There was a house burning in thedistance, our platoon was supposed to be around there somewhere. Itwas completely dark now except for the light the burning house gaveoff. We crossed an open field and came opposite the house. Wecouldn't find anyone. We were in an open field silhouetted againstthe river by the burning house. Small arms fire was sailing aroundand 88s were whistling over our heads and hitting on the other sideof the river. That was a very bad spot to be in, so we retreated backto our hole.</p><p>The 1st Platoon was moving up. When they saw the three of uscoming toward them they thought we were Jerries and someone fired. Weyelled and told them to stop. I can't see why he missed us we were soclose to him.</p><p>A little later the 3rd Platoon came back so Tucker, Sloan, andIremained in our hole and got a fair night's sleep. It was raining andplenty miserable out.</p><p>In the morning there was some activity. Both the GIs andJerrieswere firing, but we couldn't figure out exactly where they werefiring from.</p><p>Capt. Craig came right up to the front about 10 yards from ourhole and stood up scanning the terrain looking for the Jerries withhis field glasses. That is the last mistake he ever made. A burp gunopened up on him and two bullets went through his head. He diedinstantly. Lt. Milner became our company commander.</p><p>Ferringer and Brussard were both hit in the arms that day. Ourplatoon moved forward to try and drive the snipers out of theirhiding but we failed and came back hours later.</p><p>As darkness fell the company organized and we moved out atrightangles from our original attacking direction. After marching for sometime we dug slit trenches on the side of a dyke. The 2nd Platooncouldn't be found. Demop, Sloan, and I were sent out 300 yards to ourleft flank to find them but we had no luck. We came back and Demopand I tried to get some sleep in our slit trench. Shortly we got upfor some chow; it was sandwiches and a little cake. We froze andslept until daybreak.</p><p>We moved to a certain area by a house and prepared for anattack.I remember finding a pear tree with nice juicy pears. We moved outwell spread out. We crossed pastures, drainage ditches and cleared afew houses. Ahead was a town. It was fair sized. When we reached theedge we were fired upon and we all hit the ground. I got behind apile of turnips. In time we advanced one at a time in short runs. Oursquad built a skirmish line up along a ditch and fired at anythingthat could be a possible hiding place for a Jerry.</p><p>After awhile we pulled back a hundred yards and dug in. DemopandI dug a pretty good hole that we could lay down in. It had a coverand we lined it with blankets we looted from a nearby house. We alsofound a jar of apple sauce that we ate.</p><p>We were all ready to spend the night there when we were toldtoprepare to pull out. It was evening now and we moved into town withno opposition. We searched out the houses pretty good and pushed onthrough to the other end where we dug in. Demop, Roy, and I dug ahole together. It rained that night but our hole stayed dry. We heardsmall arms fire ahead of us and were told it was Polish troopscutting us off from the flanks. We all felt pretty happy. We stood noguard.</p><p>In the morning we got some C-rations. We marched a shortdistanceto waiting trucks. Our fighting here was over! We were all happyalthough no one knew where we were going. We all hoped for the armyof occupation and many seriously believed that is what we were goingto do. We rode out of Holland into Belgium and stopped in an openfield outside of Odenbush. Here we prepared to spend the night. Oursquad hitchhiked into town to get a shower but we were too late.</p><p>We were supposed to pitch tents for the night but Demop and Iwentlooking for a shelter. We walked around a house and approached someBelgium people. They asked us what we wanted. Demop made themunderstand and they told us to come into their house. We told them wewould come back after chow.</p><p>When we came back they had a bed all fixed up for us, butbeforewe went to bed we talked (as best we could) for a long time. As bestas I could figure out this was a father, two daughters, a son, andanother man. The son was a schoolteacher in Odenbush and could speaka little English. The two daughters were about twenty and verypretty. One was married.</p><p>When we went to bed we took our clothes off for the first timesince we entered combat. We slept very good. We thanked the peoplefor their hospitality and went back to our area.</p><p>After breakfast we boarded trucks and went for a long ride inasoutheasterly direction. Toward evening we were near the Germanborder outside of Aachen. I guess most of us realized then that wewere not occupation troops. We passed through the broken-down city ofAachen, and out into a woods. It was pitch black when we detruckedand went into a nearby woods. We were told to dig slit trenches, butthat was impossible. The brush was so thick and the night so darkthat we could not see what we were doing. Sloan and I spread ourblankets on the ground and went to sleep.</p><p>In the morning we ate breakfast and rested all day. In theeveningwe again got into trucks and headed toward the front. We learned wewere relieving the 1st Division who were holding a position inpillboxes on the Siegfried line. Just the thought of living with aroof over our heads made us very happy.</p><p>We detrucked and marched to our area as night was falling. Itwasrainy, cold, and muddy. Our platoon had two pillboxes to live in. Werelieved the 1st Division squad for squad. When we asked them if theyhad a good deal here most of them said yes. Later it was easy to seethese fellows had a pretty tough time of it.</p><p>The pillboxes were very crowded. There were about 11 bunks andabout twice that many men. Quite a few of the fellows were on guardand the extra ones just had to sleep in shifts. But nobody complainedvery much. We had a dry place to sleep and that is what we mostwanted.</p><p>The guard posts were rotated between the three squads. For twodays a squad stayed in one pillbox and then moved to the other onewhich was a far better deal. The first night Demop and I stayed in ahole for the first half of the night and then slept far into the nextday until we had to go on again. The next night the entire squad hadto go to an outpost in a broken-down pillbox. It was cold and rainyand the roof leaked like a sieve so it was very miserable. At firstit rained every night we were in this place and our feet were alwayswet. Most of the boys went back with trench foot. I also got a casebut is wasn't too bad.</p><p>The third night was by far the best. We moved to the otherpillboxwhere there was more room. During the night we ran two-man patrols toE Company a half mile to our right. That night Demop and I made eighttrips.</p><p>The squads kept rotating in this manner as long as we stayedhere(about a week). The chow was not too good. We got two hot meals andone 10-in-1-meal per day. We had to carry the chow about a half milethrough mud and that was no fun.</p><p>Demopulos went back for a two or three day rest. He was reallyasad case now.</p><p>One day I was dozing in my bunk and I overheard our squadleader,Jack Allen, discussing with some of the men about moving the men todifferent positions in the squad. He said he needed someone for ascout. One of the guys said, "Well, if you're looking for the bestone of us, it's Svec. One day with shells falling all over the placehe came up to my foxhole and asked me how I was doing. I asked him ifhe wasn't afraid of getting hit out there and he said the shellsweren't too close just then." Another guy said, "Yeah, that Svec isfearless."</p><p>I was wide awake then listening to the guys talking about meandfeeling pretty good that my friends thought well of me when Jacksaid, "Well, I guess that's my man for scout." I jumped out of thebunk and protested loudly and told them I was as scared as they wereof dying, but maybe I didn't show it as much and that they were justmaking sure I was moved forward and not them. It didn't do any good;I was the new scout.</p><p>About the day we moved out we got these replacements-DaleBlair,Ed Canter, and Langly, a fairly good bunch of guys.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h4><b><a name="Nov1_1994"></a>Nov. 1,1944</b></h4><p>One day about noon, Demop and I were standing guard in afoxhole.We had an hour yet to go when the new relief came. They said we weremoving out and to go get ready. When we got back everyone was rushingaround getting ready. In a half hour we were moving out.</p><p>Maxwell was first scout and I was second. We moved out to therearand then down a railroad track towards a woods. Just as we reachedthe woods enemy shells started coming in. The lead scout in anothersquad was hit in the eye with shrapnel.</p><p>When we got into the woods Maxwell and I went out pretty farahead. We saw evidence of a tough fight here at one time. There wereGI foxholes and equipment all over the place; the 1st Division wasprobably stopped here when they came through months ago. We moved onahead through the thick woods. Our platoon was advancing toward anopen space. Just as one scout reached the edge of the woods a machinegun opened up to our right front. No one knew if it was enemy or ourown troops so no one fired. Maxwell and I just stood there in theopen wondering what to do. The machine gun opened up again and thistime the bullets cut branches quite near us. We hit the ground andsome of us fired back. The enemy fire was coming from a woods about150 yards away. Everyone started digging in from a prone position asthe machine gun continued firing in bursts. I still can't figure outwhy none of us weren't hit. Demop came up and we dug in together. Weput a top on our hole and camouflaged it good.</p><p>We had quite a fire fight then. The enemy had about threedifferent places where they were firing machine guns and burp gunsfrom. One was to our right flank. With all that lead flying around Iknew someone would be hit sooner or later. Tucker in the 2nd Squadwas hit in the shoulder shortly after.</p><p>In our squad we were pretty lucky. Carter was grazed in thebackof the head. He went back to the aid station but came right backagain. Krupanic had a bullet go in the pocket of his overcoat. Berghad a K-ration shot out of his pack. I had an extra pair of shoesthat I brought along laying at the entrance of my hole. As I wasfiring, the enemy machine gun cut loose. I heard the bullets snapclose to me and kick up dirt. I ducked into the hole and didn't getup for awhile. When I did come out I saw a hole through the toe of myshoe that was laying a foot from my head. I was really burned upabout losing that good pair of shoes.</p><p>When night came all was quiet. Demop and I took turns standingguard. In the morning word came down to fall back. It was getting alittle too hot there. Our platoon was out ahead of the rest of thecompany. We were told to withdraw individually by running back andtaking as much cover as possible, about 200 yards behind our originalposition. We dug in again. I lost track of Demop so I dug in bymyself. Since the shells were coming in and exploding in the treesthere was lots of shrapnel hitting everywhere. I quickly dug a verynarrow, shallow trench and was putting a roof on when John Rutledgecame along. He had just been wounded and patched up at an aidstation. There was so much confusion with the shelling they didn'tsend him back to the hospital right away and he had to look forcover. John asked me if he could share my hole since he couldn't digwith one hand. I said sure if we could squeeze in-it was too late towiden the hole and too dangerous to start over. We crawled in but I'mafraid John wasn't very well protected with his lanky body butfortunately he wasn't hit again. He wasn't nervous like Demop andnever complained about his wound even though it must have hurtplenty. When there was a lull in the shelling John was finally ableto get back to safety. (John and I sought each other out after thewar and became life-long friends).</p><p>All that day they pounded us with artillery, mortars, andanythingelse they could throw at us. The other platoons got the most of itthough. About four men were killed and innumerable were wounded. Oneshell knocked out an entire machine gun squad. Later I found out thiswas the infamous Hurtgen Forest where the 1st Division said they hadtheir toughest fighting. Incoming shells would always explode in thetrees and shrapnel would fly in all directions, thereby causing twiceas many casualties as ground explosions. The only safe place was in acovered foxhole. In another platoon two boys were lying in an openfoxhole. A shell came in and after the explosion the one boy askedthe other if he was OK. The boy didn't answer and upon examination itwas found that a very large piece of shrapnel cut through his back,killing him instantly.</p><p>In the early afternoon everything became quiet. I decided togo toour forward position to pick up some rations and ammunition that wereleft there when we withdrew. I walked up to the front hole, picked upsome packs and ammo and started back when three shots were fired atme. One shot went over my head and hit a tree in front of me and theothers went on either side. I immediately hit the ground and startedthinking fast. There was a large fallen tree in front of me so Icouldn't run out. I couldn't go around the tree because I could beseen by the enemy. My only chance was to get up quick and jump overthe tree. Apparently the enemy figured I was hit because I didn'tmove and they didn't fire. I dropped everything but my rifle and madea dash. I jumped on the fallen tree and over it and then took off.Only one shot was fired but it was another miss. I ran all the wayback to my hole and resolved never again to do a foolish thing likethat.</p><p>It was during this battle that I later heard an interestingstoryabout our company commander, Capt. Milner. He was also in a coveredfoxhole somewhere in the thick of the shelling. Apparently they hadphone connection to battalion. The major wanted to know how thingswere progressing. Our Capt., in a very serious voice said, "WellMajor, you know those trees I said they were knocking down? Well nowthey are making sawdust out of them!"</p><p>I forgot to mention that the night before Maxwell and Bergwentback with trench foot. They tried to get Jack Allen to go back alsobut Jack said he wouldn't go until we got through this attack. (Theultimate conscientious soldier. It cost him his life.) Sloan had leftus when we were still in the pillboxes because of sickness so thatleft us with a ten-man squad.</p><p>Well, something just had to be done about the situation. Wejustweren't doing any good hiding in our holes while the enemy shelledus.</p><p>About two hours before dark we got the plans for an attemptedbreakthrough. It didn't look very good for us. Our squad was to doall the work. It was believed that there was a pillbox in front of uswhere the machine guns were firing at us. It was our squad'sobjective to take that pillbox. We were issued "beehives," polecharges, and satchel charges. I carried a "beehive," a large chargeof dynamite. One plan was to circle around through thick woods to theright of the pillbox. Then I would run up to it, plant the "beehive,"pull the fuse, and take off. If that wouldn't work the other fellowswould try with their charges. We would not have a medic along sothings didn't look good for us. The boys griped saying it was asuicide mission, but I just took my optimistic view of things andhoped for the best.</p><p>The enemy positions were now being pounded by our ownartillery.Our platoon moved into its forward position. When the artillerystopped at a given time our squad took off on our mission. Apparentlythe Jerries were still ducking because we weren't fired on as wemoved out of our holes. Jack Allen led and I followed him through thewoods. We went between two ponds, up a steep slope, and then ran intobarbed wire. Here we stopped to look over the situation. The onlything we could do was cut our way through the barbed wire. I took apair of clippers and started cutting a path. We were very near theenemy so I laid on my back, cut the wire as quietly as possible, andthen dragged myself forward under the upper strands. Jack followed.After doing this for a few yards I heard Jerries whispering andtalking in low tones. I then realized how close we were to them(actually about 20 feet). I motioned to Jack to back out and Ifollowed. If the Jerries spotted us there we would have been helplesssince we could not have retreated fast because of the top strands ofwire.</p><p>After we got out from under the wire we had to plan anotherway.Jack began creeping down along the wire. A shot was fired at him,hitting the wire a foot over his head. The Jerries had spotted him.We could hear them giving commands and they fired some more. It wastime for us to scram. I asked Jack if we should give them a volley ofgrenades before leaving, but he said, "No, let's get out of herequick." We did. We went to the edge of the woods near our positionsbut could not see any of our platoon. We thought maybe they hadretreated to our old positions. We started back but then I saw Lt.Turner in a hole and told him we thought they had gone back. He said,"Hell no, we would have stayed here until hell froze over." He saidwe should go to our forward positions and wait for an order to pullback. I heard Jack say, "All I want to do is get back to my oldhole." We went to different holes. There were plenty of empty holesaround because more men were hit. Beeken, Taylor, and Carrothers werehit. (We heard Carrothers had the top of his head blown off. It wentsomething like this. "Is he living?" "Yes, but not for long. You cansee his brains." We never heard another word. We assumed he died.Then 50 years later he shows up at the Minneapolis reunion hale andhearty and talking better than I ever could.)</p><p>I went back to my old hole, There was no one very near to meand Iwas worried that they would pull back and forget about me so I stayedawake. It was near pitch black. The enemy machine gun continued tofire in bursts. After awhile I was concerned that everyone had pulledback so I got out of my hole and looked around. I found Demop in ahole and asked him where Jack Allen was. He said in a hole behind alittle ways. I went there and saw Jack in a hole with his headsticking out. I called to him but he didn't answer. I figured he mustbe asleep so I called some more and then shook him. It was then Inoticed he was not asleep but unconscious. A bullet had entered hisleft temple, went through his head and out the right temple. I felthis pulse; it was still faintly beating. I called back to Gonzales,the medic, to come up. I was very excited and called entirely tooloud but I didn't care about anything except to get him help.Gonzales finally came up; he was scared stiff. He patched Jack's headalthough we both knew by this time it was hopeless. I held Jack'shand until his pulse stopped beating and I felt terrible. I went backand asked Lt. Turner what we should do. He said we were going to pullback to the rear positions and I should get some help and take Jackback. Four of us started carrying Jack on a stretcher made of araincoat and two rifles. We stumbled through the pitch-black woodsand fallen trees until we just couldn't go any farther. We were justabout lost anyway so we decided to leave Jack there and try to findour way back. Others carried Jack out the next day. Stricker and Istumbled through the woods, circled around a few times, and finallyfound the platoon CP. Lt. Turner still had not come back so we waitedthere. Striker was in a terrible nervous condition; he wouldn't evenstick his head out of the hole. Carrying your dead buddy through apitch black woods and wondering when they will be carrying you outwould unnerve anyone if you let it get to you. Shortly Lt. Turner andsome others came back. I went back to my old hole. Demop and Krupinichad gone earlier looking for a stretcher but never came back.</p><p>In about an hour Lt. Turner told me to go down to the companyCPwith the runner, Andrews. Capt. Milner wanted to talk to me. To getto the CP we had to go through about 500 yards of fallen timbers.After much trouble we finally found the hole where Capt. Milner was.He wanted to know exactly what happened and the location of theenemy. After I told him all I knew he thanked me and told us to goback to our holes. When we got back I altered guard with Thompsonuntil morning. In the morning everything was quiet. I had to go on adetail with about 15 others from the Company to bring in someK-rations. Capt. Milner led us about a half mile to an area where thecooks had brought up the rations. We each took a carton and startedback. After getting tangled up a few times we finally got back.</p><p>Demop and Krupinic still weren't back. We later learnedKrupinicsprained his knee and never did come back to the outfit. Demop brokea lens in his glasses and also never came back. They said he hadbattle fatigue and wound up in the Quartermaster Corps.</p><p>I sat by my hole eating K-rations for some time. I took off myshoes because my feet were hurting. I had a mild case of trench foot;my feet were red and hot. At night they would get cold and hurtsomething terrible.</p><p>I was just thinking of getting some sleep when Lt. Turnercalledme over. Sgt. Conally was here with his squad. They were supposed togo on a patrol where our squad had been to see if the enemy was stillthere. Our artillery threw white phosphorus in earlier to chase theJerries out. Conally didn't know where to go and wanted someinformation from me. He asked if I would come along with them and Isaid OK. I didn't want to go of course. I was having a tough timestaying alive in my own squad without being loaned out to others, butI was the only one that knew exactly where to go to stay out of theline of fire. I led the patrol through the same way Jack had led usthe day before. When we reached the barbed wire we stopped. Conallyand I threw some grenades where Jack and I heard enemy voices lastnight to see if we could stir them up and find out if they were stillthere. We heard nothing. Conally and I moved down the fence a ways.He was very nervous and was ready to turn back, but I said we mightas well go on a little farther; he agreed. I cut my way through thefence and Conally followed. There was a trench a few yards in frontof us that we jumped into and called the rest of the fellows up.Conally sent one man back to bring up the company. We immediatelysearched out the trench system that was very extensive. There was nopillbox as we had expected. Wilson and I walked down the trench for along ways without seeing anyone. After walking about 100 yards wegave it up and came back. Conally was irked at us for disappearingfor so long so I grumpily said, "Well, if it means anything to youthe area in that direction is all clear for at least 100 yards." Hesaid he was only looking out for our safety and he thanked me andsaid he would let Lt. Turner know that it was me who made the advancepossible. Whether that happened I never was sure; Lt. Turner wasn'tthe kind of person that went around praising his men, but then no oneelse did either. Anyway things were getting out of hand. All I everwanted to be was an unnoticed rifleman that stayed out of the line offire, but now it seemed I was being pushed to the front. I felt alittle uncomfortable even though I was somewhat flattered.</p><p>As the company moved up I joined my platoon. We moved toanotherwoods and started digging in but before we finished we moved out. Wewalked through the woods with the platoon on line. I became assistantsquad leader in our squad. Thompson, of course, was squad leader. Anhour before dark we dug in a turnip patch beside a railroad track.Dale Blair and I dug in together. It rained but our hole shed waterfairly well. We intended to stand guard but we both fell asleep andnever got out of our hole until ten o'clock in the morning when wemoved out. We continued our march through the woods. We hit noresistance. After walking for a long time we came to a main road andour eyes almost popped out when we saw our own tanks parked on theroad. Here we expected to hit the enemy at any time and instead wemeet this. We reorganized and waited for things to get straightenedout. The major was there so we figured the situation was well inhand. The 2nd Platoon got on the tanks and the rest of us walkedbeside them down the road. We were heading for the city ofEschweiller. Someone cracked a pretty good joke. He said if we foughthard enough we could sleep in houses that night.</p><p>When we were about a half mile from the outskirts ofEschweillerincoming 88s warned us the enemy knew we were coming. Progress wasvery slow because trees had to be cleared from the road to let thetanks go through. When the 88s came closer we were ordered off theroad and into a field. We commenced digging in but soon a terrificrainstorm came. There was nothing to do but keep digging in the mudand water. Dale and I dug a drainage ditch in our hole so the waterdrained to one end and into a deeper hole. This left us high and dry.We got some straw at a nearby farmhouse and made a comfortable bed.It was getting dark as we finished the hole. We crawled in and wentto sleep. I had to take off my shoes because my feet were hurting.The trench foot was getting to me.</p><p>About midnight Thompson came around and woke us; it was stillraining out. Lt. Wright was going to lead the 1st Platoon and theremains of the 3rd-about 16 men-into Eschweiller on a night attack.But we didn't know that. The night was so black we couldn't see ourhands in front of our faces. To keep from getting lost we had to holdon to the man in front of us. Everyone was so confused that it wasimpossible to find out the situation or what we were doing. Thingsgot straightened out when we moved out in single file with Lt. Wrightin the lead. We moved down the road into Eschweiller. But most of usdidn't know what the devil we were supposed to be accomplishing.</p><p>We came to a few buildings and Lt. Wright had a few men searchouteach building. He told Sgt. Lowe to clear out one but Lowe told me totake a couple of men and do it. We went in the house while Lowe stoodoutside. Although I never showed it, I never forgave him for thatdeal. We couldn't see a thing it was so black. I told the guys tostand aside and I made a lot of noise. I figured if there were anyJerries in there they would have done something about it. It's theonly way I could think of to get the job done. The guys thought I wascrazy. We went back and told Lowe the house was cleared.</p><p>After all the houses were checked we moved off the road intothewoods. An enemy machine gun was firing to our left. Fortunately theydidn't hear us. To our front we could see factory buildings; weheaded for them.</p><p>I really got burned up at Sgt. Lowe. Lt. Wright would keepsendingout patrols to the flanks to make sure everything was OK. When hecalled for Lowe, Lowe wouldn't say a word and then someone else hadto go. The worst part of the whole thing was that he even ducked awayfrom his squad so they were all confused. I guess if I would havesquealed on him he wouldn't have lasted long as a non-com. But thefirst rule of battle is to keep your enemies in front of you. As itwas I didn't say a word and even stayed the best of friends withLowe. I guess he must have figured I forgot all about that night, orelse made an extra effort to be especially nice to me to keep mequiet. As long as I remember Lowe, I'll remember that night.</p><p>We crossed a railroad and walked along some factory buildings.Some of us went into a house and sat down. In an hour daylight brokeand we got straightened out a bit. Lowe and I went to a large factorywhere most of our platoon was. The factory had windows on all sideswith concrete floors and brick walls. On the second floor we starteda bonfire and dried out our clothes. While we were huddled around thefire a burst of machine gun fire plowed through the windows above ourheads. We all scattered but the warmth of the fire drew us back.</p><p>All that day we looked out of windows but couldn't see theJerries. In the afternoon the rest of the company came up and thenother outfits on the right and left came in. That made us all feelmore secure. Before that there was only one full-strength platoon inthe entire city of Eschweiller. We were mighty lucky in that attack;we caught the Jerries sleeping. In the morning they awoke and weresure surprised. Some surrendered and some were shot before they knewwhat was happening.</p><p>The company doctor came to our factory to check out anyonewithhealth complaints. I decided to have him look at my feet. He said itwas as bad a case of trench foot as he had seen and that he wouldsend me back to the hospital if I wanted to go. He then said if Ikept my feet dry I would be as well off as lying in a hospital. Isaid, "OK, I'll stick around here with my friends." The "room" was amake-shift affair made of blankets hung on ropes to separate if fromthe factory. GIs were sitting next to the blankets and could hearevery word said inside but I didn't know this. As I walked outsomeone said, "Hey Svec, we can't believe you. All us guys aresitting here thinking up things to tell the doc to get a trip backand here you have one and refuse it. Why?" I laughed and said, "Ithink it would be pretty boring in the hospital," and walked away. Iguess I had them baffled. My real reason was that I saw many newrecruits come to the front lines and many previously wounded comeback and they always seemed to be the first ones hit. I thought itwas because they weren't oriented to the area and the recenthappenings and were more susceptible to being hit than a person thatwas in the thick of the fighting all the time. (Incidentally, thetrench foot bothered me the rest of my life).</p><p>That night we slept in the factory and the next day we movedoutto take the rest of the town. Apparently the enemy fled during thenight. We walked down the streets and took the enemy without a fight.When we reached the outskirts of town we stopped. The buildings herewere really mansions. They had every modern convenience imaginable.Our squad consisted only of five men and we occupied the last houseat the end of town. We holed up in the basement where Jerries hadbeen only a few hours before. The fire in the stove was still going.That night we stood guard at the door, two men at a time. In themorning we had a hot meal. The kitchen had actually come up duringthe night.</p><p>In the morning we cleaned up a room so we would have someplace tomove around. Lt. Turner called me over and said one man from eachplatoon was being sent to Paris on a two-day pass and he picked mefrom the 3rd Platoon. I figured I was the luckiest man alive. Therewas a lull in the fighting and I didn't worry about thedisorientation when I got back.</p><p>In the afternoon the six of us that were going to Paris fromthecompany went on a truck ride to get a shower and clean clothes. Wecame back after dark.</p><p>I slept in the cellar of our house again and in the morning weleft for Paris in trucks. The fellows from our company were Tuffel,Soap, Hunter, Gamble, Whorley, and myself. We had a lot of funcracking jokes and eating D-bars.</p><p>Toward morning we reached Riemes, Belgium where we stayed forthenight in a dormitory. We slept on the floor in a cold room. In themorning we ate and then drove the rest of the way to Paris.</p><p>In Paris we all stayed at the Hotel Modern. Each person had aroomto himself. The room was complete with running water and a real bed;it was wonderful. In the lobby we could buy doughnuts and coffeeanytime. But everything seemed very strange to me. I seemed to be allalone in the world. Although I had it very nice now, there didn'tseem to be much to look forward to but going back to the front in acouple of days. Even there most of my friends were gone, at least theclose ones. That night I wandered around Paris a little and then wentto sleep in that great bed. I got up at 9 o'clock just in time to eatbreakfast.</p><p>It was Sunday and all the stores were closed. I wanted to buyaChristmas present but now it looked impossible. Later I did find astore that was open and bought a bracelet for ten bucks. I never sentit until after Christmas. That day I also took a sightseeing touraround Paris. We stopped at every place that was worthwhile seeing.The guide told us so many things that it just went in one ear and outthe other. Later I went on my own and looked over the French operahouse that Grandpa said I should see because it was so beautiful. (Mygrandfather was a stone mason and artist and repaired buildingsaround Europe before he immigrated to America in the 1800s).</p><p>That night I went to sleep early and got up late again. Weweregoing to leave at noon so I hung around the hotel eating doughnutsand coffee. I wrote a letter home telling them where I was and aboutJack Allen. (Jack had sent my home address to his mother. His motherand mine became pen pals trying to keep track of us. After the war Idrove up to Ironton, Michigan to see his parents. They were as niceas you would expect having raised a son like Jack).</p><p>All afternoon we traveled and in the evening we again arrivedatReims where we spent the night. In the morning we started for thelast stretch to the front. Everyone seemed quite cheerful. I couldn'thelp but wonder how many of this group would survive the nextbattles. No one knew what we were coming back to because they mightalready have pushed off in attack.</p><p>Toward evening we came back to the same place we left. I wenttothe CP to see Lt. Turner. He wanted to know how I liked Paris andsaid I came back at the wrong time; they were getting ready for anattack. He also told me I was now a corporal, but I would have to goto a different squad later on. Thompson tried to argue Lt. Turnerinto keeping me as his assistant, but Lt. Turner said, "I'm lookingout for the whole platoon and you're just concerned about your squad;Svec goes."</p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(Some pages aremissing here-lost throughthe years. I remember some things that happened that weren'tmentioned on the existing papers. One time we were staying in a smalltown for quite a few days. They decided to truck us all to a rearposition for showers and a change of clothes. All the trucks wereparked in an open field where we climbed into them. As we sat there aplane dove down on us and dropped a bomb that exploded nearby. We alldove off the trucks and hit the ground. A boy that was sitting acrossfrom me was hit in the crotch and lost his vital parts. In thehospital he said he wished he would have been hit in the headinstead. He was a little quicker than I was jumping off the truck andtook the hit probably protecting me. The plane of course wasours.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(Our squad of 12were all staying in oneroom and it was really crowded. They all smoked but me and at timesthe air quality was bad. I frequently made sarcastic remarks abouttheir dumb smoking. I said I never had a cigarette between my lipsand never would. Someone said that just changed and the whole squadjumped me and tried to get a lit cigarette in my mouth. I was on topof the bed, under the bed, all over the room, but they neversucceeded. We laughed about that for weeks.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(Stricker found acow in a field that waswounded by shrapnel. He butchered the cow and cut the meat into allthe various types. We were the most popular squad at mealtime. Lt.Turner would sometimes order a few steaks. We joked about sendingsome steaks to the top brass and maybe we would stay in reserveforever.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(There was anotherhouse our squad stayedin near a factory. One day we heard a different kind of noiseoverhead and then a loud explosion. We later learned it was a Germanjet plane dropping a bomb. This is before the United Stated had evenflown one. Once a day the jet would fly over and drop one bombsomewhere. When we heard the jet we would dive for the basement butif the bomb would have been heading for us we probably would havebeen too late. Later on I figured this out and just stayedupstairs.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(After Sloanrecovered from his sicknesshe was placed in a division headquarters group as a jeep driver foran officer. We heard he was driving down a road alone when a Germanplane swooped down and strafed him. He was found in the ditch dead.We wondered if he would have been better off with us. I rememberedthat sunny day after some tough fighting when I said to him, "It sureis great to be alive," and Sloan said, "It sure is old buddy." I washappy to be alive but so sad my good friend was gone. It didn't seemright that I could feel happy and sad at the same time or even fairbut that's the way it seemed to be. Emotions run wild when yourfriends are dying.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(The nicest placewe stayed in thatwinter was in the town of Merken. My squad (it seems I became a squadleader because someone must have been wounded, probably Thompson) hada nice house complete with a large living room and bedrooms. Nearbywe found beehive equipment and a lot of beeswax. We made candles outof the beeswax but it was hard to light up that large living room. Ifound one paper describing how we went about correctingthis.)</i></font></p><p>One day I had a bight idea and our lighting system wasassured. Ifound a large mirror and we hung it over our living room table. Wethen hung candles below the mirror. With four candles the room waslit up about as good as with an electric light. The mirror reflectedthe light even better than expected.</p><p>Since we had so much time on our hands we played cards a lot.Theboys taught me how to play bridge, poker (we did not gamble), casino,hearts, and others. A couple of evenings we asked Lt. Turner over toplay bridge.</p><p>One day our battalion commander, Major Denisovich, and two RedCross girls came by to talk to the boys. They came into our livingroom and thought it was very nice; especially our lightingsystem.</p><p>Yes, these days at Merken were really wonderful, but it wasmainlybecause we made it that way for ourselves. It could have been a veryboring three weeks if we would have been content not to better ourliving conditions.</p><p>There was one incident that ruined the whole stay at Merken.Oneday as we were going to chow across the street, an enemy mortar shellfell in the street about 20 yards away. I was in the building at thetime. I heard a scream and came out to find one of the boys had beenhit. It was Tony Lawanga from Rigsby's squad. A piece of shrapnel hadcut through his arm and into his chest. Skidmore, the medic, patchedhim up the best he could and a jeep rushed him to an aid station, buthe died in the jeep. The whole thing happened so fast we could hardlybelieve it. <i>(Now the papers are missing again and I'll notesomethings that I still remember today.)</i></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(One day Ireceived a letter from home.My brother, Chuck, was in the 84th Infantry Division that wasfighting just south of the 104th. The Battle of the Bulge startedwhen we were at Merken. It was the last large German counterattack ofthe war. Chuck was wounded with three machine gun bullets through thestomach and was in very bad shape. The next letter said he was flownto England in critical condition. The surgeon in England kept sendingmy parents telegrams explaining Chuck's progress, but none of themwere encouraging. Finally he got better and was flown home where heeventually recovered. I told Basil Beeken about the bad news as itwas happening and he felt sorry for me. His brother, who was also inthe 84th, was still OK. Later he told me his brother was killed inthe 84th's last battle of the war. I felt so sorry for him I didn'tknow what to say.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(I received morebad news from hometown.My girlfriend sent me a Dear John letter-she was engaged. She took afine time to leave me and I felt terrible.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(One day Lt.Turner sent for me. He wasordered to organize a patrol to search the river for enemy activity.We picked about ten men. Lt. Turner would lead and I would bring upthe rear. We were issued white raincoats and boots to camouflageourselves against the snow. When darkness came we started out acrossthe quarter mile of open field toward the river. When we reached theriver we turned left and walked along the bank for awhile. Shellswere whistling over our heads in both directions. It was very foggy,especially over the river. We stopped and Lt. Turner called meforward. The two of us were going in the water. We moved slowlyacross the river; we had to stay close together to keep from losingeach other. When we were about halfway across and hip deep Lt. Turnertold me to stay there while he went forward. He moved about ten feetand disappeared in the fog. I wondered how he would ever find me. Afew minutes later I saw a form coming towards me. I hoped it washim-it was. I always wondered how he found me in that soup. He said,"Let's get out of here" and we did. Going back we were walkingicicles. Lt. Turner got a silver star for that night; I got my trenchfoot reactivated.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(I don't know whenor where this happenedbut it must have been in this gap of missing papers. It might havebeen after the three weeks at Merken on our winter break. I think wecrossed a river in boats on a very dark night. We got into a town andstayed in houses that night. I was briefly in one house in a roomwith five other GIs. One of our men outside didn't know we were inthe house and dropped a grenade in our room through an open window.It exploded and amazingly none of the six of us werehit.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(There was someresistance and one of ourofficers was killed in the middle of a street. My squad stayed in thelast house in the town; the one nearest the enemy. In the morning wemoved out across a field to take the next nearby town that might havebeen Weischwieller. I believe they made it a day attack because theysuspected the town was surrounded by anti-personnel mines which wouldhave blown us apart in the dark. There were haystacks in the fieldand we were darting between them as enemy small arms fired at us. Mysquad was more to the rear and word was passed back that Lt. Turnerwas just killed with a bullet in the head. That one really got to me.I always thought he would be there as long as I was around. The enemyfire finally stopped and we started to walk to the town. Seeing Lt.Turner lying there was especially unnerving for me. They were rightabout the minefield and we had to thread our way through it. I was insort of a stupor thinking of Lt. Turner and not being too carefuluntil Connelly yelled, "Hey Svec, watch where you're going before youblow us all to hell." Lt. Turner wasn't what I could call a buddybecause he was an officer and I was a mere private or corporal so wedidn't really get together but I had a lot of respect for him and Iwas quite sure he felt that way about me. He chose me for somedangerous operations but I knew he did it because he believed mecapable. He put himself ahead of me just as often and this day wasthe last time.)</i></font></p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(Now the fiftyyear old papers continue.I'm not sure where we were at the time but this is the way itstarts.)</i></font></p><p>. . . the lead, F Company on the left and G in reserve in therear. Neanes(?) didn't know anymore about handling a platoon than theman in the moon. I guess Lt. Mauldin realized this too and 1st Sgt.Vance was put in charge of our platoon. I went back to assistantsquad leader. We moved through the woods in a single file, stoppingand starting very often. We rotated the squads on flank guard.</p><p>I still was feeling pretty lousy. I hadn't eaten for a longtimeand I was very weak. The fellows said I was as white as a sheet. Wewalked and walked until I thought I would cash in. Towards dark westopped and dug in. The company dug in a circle for all-aroundsecurity. As we were digging we were being shelled by our own tanksthat were somewhere behind us. Apparently they didn't know where wewere. The digging was tough and we had to go a long ways for timberto construct roofs on the holes. Stricker and I went 200 yards down aroad to get some lumber. As we walked back five shells landed in theroad only 50 yards behind us where we had been only a short timebefore. Other fellows weren't as lucky. In another incident, four menfrom H Company were digging in together. A tree burst wounded threeof them and killed the other. Later another of the men died. In ourcompany only two men were wounded. All this from our own artillery-itmade us plenty mad. That is the third time our own artillery did moreharm to us than the enemy did, that I have witnessed; in Holland,Huclens-Stamler, and here. It wasn't the last.</p><p>After we spent a couple of miserable cold hours in the holesweprepared to move out. I was still sick. It was pitch black in thewoods and we had some trouble keeping together. We moved in singlefile to the edge of the woods. Four hundred yards across open groundwas a burning town. I was called up to the front. Capt. Greely, headof G2, wanted a patrol to go into the town and see if it was theright one-Dansweiller. Dansweiller was supposed to have been takenearlier by the 3rd Battalion. I picked Roy and Maxwell to go withme.</p><p>We went straight to the town and headed for the firstbuilding; noone was around. We went to another house and saw a man carrying alantern. I sneaked up on him and pointed my carbine at him. The manwas a civilian and he started talking fast in German. We tried to askhim if there were any Americans in town but he couldn't understand useither. He wanted me to come to his house. I was a bit leery but wentin with him. In the cellar his family was hiding and he showed me awoman in bed with a bandaged foot. Then I finally understood what hewas trying to tell me. The woman had been wounded and patched up byour medics.</p><p>I came out of the house and went into town further. At thistimeMaxwell was ready to turn back; he didn't think there were any GIs intown. But I couldn't turn back now, I had to find out for sure. Wewalked down a street until we were halted. I saw a form in a windowbut couldn't tell if it was GI or Jerry. I quickly asked if he was GIand when he said yes three hearts continued beating. We found thatthe town was Dansweiller and that the 3rd Battalion had taken it afew hours before. We went back and reported to Capt. Greely and thenI led the company into town. We were told that all the houses hadbeen searched, but the house that our squad was assigned to had to bebroken into. We knocked the door right off its hinges and piled in. Ihad just about lain down, still sick, when I was told Capt. Mauldinwanted to see me. He wanted me to take a couple of men and go backinto the woods and find E and F Companies and lead them into town. Itook Stricker and Rutledge. Dawn was just beginning to break. Wefound E Company and led them back. F Company was supposed to followbut there was some mix-up and they didn't come in so I went backalone and led them in. Then I finally lay down on a cot and fellasleep.</p><p>I awoke at noon to eat a hot chow. The house we were in was inexcellent condition. The civilians had just left it to hide in anair-raid shelter before the town was taken. We found all kinds ofpreserves, eggs, and butter and we really ate. There was also anabundance of liquor. The civilians came back to look over their houseduring the day. I guess they almost died of heart failure when theysaw the mess we made. We had no pity for them.</p><p>The next night we also spent in this house and the next daythe1st and 2nd Squad each got a replacement. We were now only a fewmiles from Cologne and that day we got the plans for taking oursector of the city. The 104th was to take the center, 3rd Armored theleft and 3rd Division the right part of the city.</p><p>That day we moved out on foot and went to a group of buildingsnear a giant light plant that apparently supplied light to allCologne and vicinity. We stayed in a house for a couple of hoursbefore moving out again. The power plant was not damaged and thelights worked in the houses. It wasn't long before we got a radiogoing. Of all things to hear at a time like this we heard "Axis Sal."I guess that proves how strong a GI believes in what he is fightingfor; to listen to enemy propaganda just before attacking one of hislargest cities and thinking it funny.</p><p>We moved out down a road towards Cologne and after about amile ofwalking came to a small town that was packed with civilians. Therewas a dead Jerry in the street in the middle of town. A few childrenwere standing around the body apparently not fully realizing what itmeant. The older citizens walked by the body completely ignoringit.</p><p>This town was as far as any of our troops had advanced. Fromhereon our battalion was to spearhead the attack through Cologne whoseoutskirts were half a mile away. We moved across open country incolumns of files with E and F Companies on line. Our objective was alarge group of settlement houses. We reached the houses with noresistance and searched them all out. At the far end of thesettlement we stopped and went into houses, half a squad to a house.Stricker, Korn, and I went searching for preserves, bedding, andloot. We hit the jackpot in one of the houses that might have been aNazi officers' house. It looked like the occupants had left onlyrecently. There was a dog in the basement. A lot of the householdbelongings were packed in crates apparently ready for shipment. Weadvanced a little too fast for them though. We found a lot of thebest preserves I have ever eaten in Germany. The peaches and cherrieswere wonderful. We also found beaucoup liquor and champagne that someof the fellows got drunk on. We had to stop our looting because itwas getting dark. Just as I was about to bed down, word came aroundthat we were to move out in about an hour so I ate preservesinstead.</p><p>We moved out down the dark street through a railroad tunnelandthen holed up for the night in a large office building. Came the dawnand we pushed on to take the rest of Cologne. Tanks had come upduring the night and now we were going to take the city with tanksupport. We moved down a street walking beside the tanks.</p><p>We came to a high railroad track that blocked the tanks sotheyhad to turn around and come in a different way. Our squad split upand rode the tanks to protect them from bazooka fire. I didn't likeit very much because a person riding a tank makes a beautiful targetfor a sniper. Farther into town there was rifle fire; the firstelements ran into snipers. The tanks drove around another road andmet our company again. Our squad got off the tanks and joined theplatoon who was stopped along the street by sniper fire. A tank wascalled up and blasted the building where the snipers were believed tobe; then we moved out but shortly again we ran into resistance. Thistime Jerries in a house were throwing bazooka rounds our way. As wecrossed a street one boy in H Company was shot by a sniper. A dozenmen had run across that street ahead of him but the sniper shot onlyat this one. The boy fell down and tried to get up. The sniper pumpeda few more rounds into the fallen GI and killed him. A tank wasbrought up and blasted the house where the sniper was believed to be.When the Jerry bazooka men left we moved forward ducking in and outof doorways because snipers were firing down the street. The fire wasvery inaccurate and no one was hit. We kept stopping, then movingforward. Once we stopped and a few of us built a bonfire in abuilding. Finally, in the evening we stopped and prepared to spendthe night. We were near a hospital that was full of wounded Jerrysoldiers attended to by Red Cross nurses and army doctors. We didn'tbother them. Some of the fellows went out looting and found a jewelrystore with lots of watches. Solberg found a very expensive saxophonethat we always said he would find. There were quite a few civiliansin town walking around as if nothing was happening. That always didseem strange to us how unconcerned the civilians always were.McDonald came in with a very amazing tale. He was looking around andan old man ran out of a house crying, "Heil Hilter, Heil Hitler."Mack said, "Heil Hilter my eye, I'm an American." "American," saidthe old man. "Goot, goot," he said as he went back to his house.</p><p>About the time we found a place to stay for the night we movedoutagain. We advanced in single file through one of the most bombed outplaces of Cologne. In some places buildings and streets wereindefinable, all were heaps of rock and ruins. We met no resistanceand stopped at a large apartment building that wasn't too badlydamaged. Some civilians were living in the building and some GIs whocould speak German began a conversation. They told of the bombingsand hardships they had in the past few years. A patrol was sent outahead and looked down on the Rhine River. Cologne had been taken, allexcept a few hundred yards. We were going to finish it in the morningbut in the morning it wasn't necessary because GIs had looted theirway through every building.</p><p>I slept that night in the cellar of the apartment house. Itlookedlike we would be here for awhile so the next day we fixed up threerooms on the fourth floor of the building. When we got the placefixed up nice, Vance told me our squad had to go on outpost down bythe river. We got all our stuff together which by this time was quitea bit because of all the loot we acquired.</p><p>We went down to the Rhine and walked along the bank. We wereinplain view of the other side but were not fired upon. Apparently theJerries were so disorganized they weren't looking for us or maybethey didn't think we would be so dumb as to walk out there in theopen.</p><p>Ten yards from the river there was a large tower that musthavebeen a lighthouse at one time. In the base of the tower was one largeroom, circular in shape, with a domed ceiling. We cleaned this outand used it for our bedroom and living room. The walls of the towerwere made of four foot thickness of brick and concrete so we feltpretty safe. There were portholes in the side with windows. Above thelarge room were two smaller rooms. One room we used for the OP. Wecould sit in a chair and look through three different portholes outacross the river. It was a great setup. At the top of the tower,about seven stories high was a wooden room that could be used as adaylight OP. From here we could see four blown-out bridges that wereslumped into the water. I was crazy about this place. A phone systemwas set up so we could talk to any platoon CP or OP in the company.The original plan was to rotate the squads but our squad decided tostay here all the time.</p><p>In an upstairs room we had a 24-hour guard and at night we hadanother door guard. We made two double bunks where eight men couldsleep. I fixed up the other little room upstairs beside the OP for mybedroom. There was no stove in the room and no glass in the portholebut I stayed warm at night between two feather beds.</p><p>At first chow was our greatest problem but 10-in-1 rationssolvedthat. Every day we got a box of rations and we had more than we couldeat. If we wanted a hot meal we could always go back to the companyand eat.</p><p>I sent some loot home from here-a Nazi helmet, swords, flags,andthe like. We went looting around town when we felt the urge.</p><p>One day we had a little accident. The wooden top of our towercaught on fire by some unknown means. I think someone dropped acigarette on the dry wood and the strong wind that day started thefire. Sgt. Vance happened to be down there at the time and ordered meout of the tower. I thought that was foolish. Instead, I got a waterpail, ran to the river and filled it, and then went to the secondfloor from the top of the tower. As ashes fell from the top I spilledwater on them and kept the fire from spreading. Below Vance wasfuming up a storm because I wouldn't come down. He finally got so madI just had to come down but by that time I had succeeded in keepingthe fire from spreading. When I came down Vance really burned my hidefor disobeying him, but I just couldn't watch our tower burn.</p><p>Sgt. Vance made me move my squad to another building near thetower. I didn't like this building because it afforded no protection.We stayed that night. About midnight a couple of shells came in fromthe Jerry side. It was the first Jerry activity we noted then.Obrumbt was on guard when the shells came in. They hit pretty closeand he almost had a fit. He woke me up and headed for the basement. Iwatched out the window and saw the gun flash of the artillery pieceout across the river and then heard the shells come in. They hit onlya hundred yards in front of our building out in the river. It lookedlike they were aiming at our house. They had plenty of time toobserve where we were staying that day when the tower burned. I triedto get the company CP on the phone but it was out of order so I wokeup the next guard and headed back to the company.</p><p>It was very dark and I had trouble finding my way through therubble. It was a bit spooky to say the least. When I got back to theCP I reported the gun flash azimuth that I had taken and they phonedthe artillery. I went to see Vance and explained the situation. Isaid I would stay in that building if he insisted but I didn't likeendangering the lives of my squad. He said we should move back intothe tower in the morning if we thought it was safe. I guess I worehim out and he got tired of arguing with me. When I was leaving Vanceasked me who came with me. He had another fit when I said, "No one,"and he commenced to ream me out again. There was an order out thatGIs were supposed to travel in pairs around Cologne because some ofthe "civilians" were really soldiers who put on civilian clothes whenwe entered the city. Vance finally said, "Be careful," and I wentback to the OP.</p><p>Came the dawn and we moved back into "my" tower with nohesitation. We liked the four feet of concrete between us and theJerries.</p><p>Engineers kept messing around by the river near our tower.Theywere putting a water gauge in and doing some surveying with atransit. I went out and told them they were in plain view of theenemy and that shells had been coming in at times.</p><p>One day I was looting in a tavern near the tower and somemortarshells started falling in very close. I came out of the building andran for the tower. I ran past a church and saw two GIs lying in adoorway. They had been wounded by shrapnel from the shells while theywere surveying. One was a sergeant and the other a lieutenant. Thesergeant had been hit in the stomach and was in very bad shape. Thelieutenant was hit in the knee-neither could walk. The lieutenanttold me to get help quick so I ran to the tower but the phone wasn'tworking. The shells had cut the wire. Rutledge and I then ran back tothe company CP where they called for an ambulance and litter bearers.Eventually they evacuated the engineers but later we learned thesergeant died.</p><p>From that day on the Jerries gave us a hard time. Apparentlytheyreorganized on their side of the river and they continually sniped atus as we came from the town. A street ran along the river. Jeeps hadbeen using this a little. They started shooting at the jeeps too andreally made the boys step on the gas. Once an ambulance came by andthey shot at that too. We could see when the bullets hit the truck asit sped for cover. The law of averages never worked here because ofall the shooting the Jerries did no one was ever hit. From the OP wekept trying to locate the snipers. We suspected the fire to be comingfrom a certain house so Lt. Mauldin brought the artillery observerdown and they laid about nine 105s in the house.</p><p>One day we spotted a number of Jerries dart around thebuildingsinto a house. We could see them good with my ten-power field glassesthat I found in Huclens-Stamler. I reported this in and they relayedit to the artillery. They said I should act as the artillery observerand tell them where the rounds were hitting. The first round went wayover the target so I could hardly see the explosion. On the next oneI reported, "500 yards long and 50 yards right." The next roundmissed the building by ten yards and then they fired for effect withnine rounds and most of them hit the building. Lt. Peake, who wasrelaying my messages at the Company CP, said that the artillery boyswere ready to give me a commission because I did a better job ofzeroing in the guns than the regular FO. After that we saw Jerriesalmost every day and sometimes the artillery fired at possible JerryCPs and OPs. The Jerries fired mortar shells at our tower but theycould do no damage to that fortress. I doubt whether anarmor-piercing shell could have gotten through that wall. The Jerriesmaybe figured that out because they never tried. I was glad I foughtVance so hard to stay in the tower because it was an excellent, safeOP. We were 20 feet high right on the front line and could seeeverything the enemy was doing.</p><p>After a week of this life began to get a little dull for someofus and we began looking for trouble. There was a peninsula thatreached out into the river near our tower and formed a bay about 500yards long and 50 yards wide that was hidden from the Jerry side. Theengineers had a little rubber assault boat in the bay that they usedto check the water. One day Rutledge and I got in the boat andpaddled across the bay and explored the peninsula. In the cellar ofthe bombed out buildings were all kinds of Jerry uniforms. The way itlooked to us, as we attacked Cologne the Jerries came here and put oncivilian clothes and then went out as "civilians." I found abeautiful dress sword that I sent home.</p><p>Another foggy day Rutledge and I went boating in the bay. Thefogwas thick enough that we couldn't see the other bank of the river. Wepaddled out a little ways into the Rhine but didn't go very far forfear the current would pull us down stream. I guess we could safelysay that we were the first ones in the 104th to go boating on theRhine.</p><p>One day we heard that we were going to be relieved by the 8thDivision. We had been here a week and a half and we were all prettymuch pleased with the news. There was such a thing as our luck givingout with the shells coming in from time to time.</p><p>Early one foggy morning we moved out of our tower and anothersquad took over. We went back to the company CP where the entirecompany reorganized and then marched out.</p><p>In the end we had the best deal by getting stuck in the OPbecausewhile we had most of the time to ourselves the rest of the companyhad a training schedule. The thing that they griped about most waswhat they called "the retaking" of Cologne; the class was "streetfighting" and they were learning how to take a city. After we hadtaken a dozen towns some bright brass hatter decided we didn't knowhow to do it. When Jerry mortars landed near they called it a day andconsidered Cologne taken.</p><p>While we were here at Cologne the company got a lot ofreplacements. Our squad came up to full strength when we got "Spud"Peller and Sgt. Holshouser. Both were swell guys and fit right intoour cheerful squad.</p><p>When we moved out of our front line position we walked back toatown that could still probably be called Cologne. Our squad took overa house that had previously been occupied by GIs so we didn't have tofix it up. There was a brewery nearby so the boys had beer ontap.</p><p>The afternoon of the day we arrived here Berg and I wentlookingfor Demop because we figured he was someplace near. We walked someand hitchhiked some. We kept asking GIs where the quartermaster was.We finally met him coming down the road in a truck. After we hadtravelled about five miles we found out that he lived about a halfmile from where we stayed. I gave Demop my field glasses and a platecamera to take care of.</p><p>Demop was on his way to pick up some crates in Cologne. Wemusthave driven for an hour circling the city. The city was filled withcivilians who came out by the thousands from their cellars after theAmericans took over.</p><p>The next day everyone that had carbines had new Tryke(?)sightsput in the pieces and we went to a range to zero them in. (I wassupposed to be carrying an MI rifle but somewhere along the way Iswitched to the carbine. For our kind of night attack fighting thelightweight carbine was much more practical. To stay alive you had tobe quick not accurate when the target was a few feet away.)</p><p>We were supposed to stay in this place for a few days rest butthesituation changed and we moved out that evening. We marched a longways to the suburb on the north side of Cologne. We arrived at ourdestination as darkness fell. Our whole platoon went into a largeapartment building where we fixed up rooms to sleep in. Stricker andI fixed up a little room just for the two of us. That night our squadstood house guard while the other two squads pulled OP down by theriver. The platoon manned two OPs at night and one in the daytime. Werotated the squads between OPs and house guard. One OP was in"dugouts" and the other was in foxholes around an old Jerryantiaircraft position. In our squad we each stood three and one halfhours at a time and then had the rest of the day off. Three men hadto be on OP at a time. Jones went out with Obrumbt who wouldn't comeout of the dugout to stand guard. Stricker and I stood with him thenext night and he was very obliging in everything we told him to do.He never forgot what I said at Obrazier. (That incident must havebeen in the missing papers. Our squad was assigned to an OP in ahouse in no-man's-land on the night before a jump-off the nextmorning. We all jammed into a tiny cellar room and tried to get somesleep while one guard stayed at the top of the stairs. I awokesometime and saw that everyone was sleeping and Obrumbt was standingby the stove. I jumped up when I realized he was the guard and no onewas guarding our outpost. A Jerry could have easily dropped a grenadedown the steps and finished us all off. I read him the riot act andtold him if he ever put my squad in danger again I would report himas a deserter or much worse. He saw Stricker kill that cow and it wasvery bloody. Obrumbt probably thought I brought Stricker out there todo a job on him. After that I always wanted to know where Obrumbt wasin battle since I broke the rule, "Always keep the enemy in front ofyou.")</p><p>During the days we spent most of the time looting thebuildings.The cellars of the houses were filled with packages and trunks. Whenthe people left they couldn't take their belongings with them. In thefew days we were there we didn't come anywhere near opening all thetrunks. Some of the fellows found cameras, watches, and othervaluables. Stricker and I were more interested in preserves. We foundsauerkraut, strawberries, and other fruit. I found a shotgun andStricker and I went pigeon hunting a couple of times.</p><p>Capt. Milner came back and took over as company commander. Lt.Mauldin became executive officer.</p><p>When we first came to this place there were no lights in thebuildings but it didn't take long for some of the boys to stretch aline where there was electricity. We found plenty of radios and heardEnglish broadcasts.</p><p>Our daylight OP was in an end building about 700 yards fromtheriver. It was a lousy OP all the way around. To approach it we had towalk down a street in plain view of the enemy. The building had nowindows on the river side so we couldn't see much. I tried to getVance to change the OP to another building to the right of this onewhich was a perfect OP but he wouldn't listen. I suppose he was stillsmoldering from our last run-in. The day before we moved out of hereMichael, Greer, and Eddy Canter were standing in a third floor roomof the OP. The Jerries threw a shell at the building and made adirect hit. The shell was a dud and came right through the wall andmade a direct hit on Michael and cut him in half. Eddy Canter was allcut up from flying bricks and Greer who was standing next to Michaeldid not get a scratch. He was covered with Michael's blood and gutsas he ran down the street to the platoon CP for help. Eddy Canter wasevacuated; besides his cuts, he had a broken leg. Michael's remainswere hauled away later. I still say that Vance was the cause ofMichael's death just as surely as if he had stabbed him in the back.At the time of the accident when I heard Michael had been killed Isaid, "Oh no, not Michael." I didn't want it to be him because he wassuch a happy guy and we had so much fun together. But he was dead andthat was all there was to it.</p><p>After that day when Greer would have too much to drink andsomebody would mention Michael to him he would crack up and almost gocrazy.</p><p>We all lost heart in looting after that and were glad when wewererelieved early one night by another division. We walked back to thehousing project in the west side of Cologne that we had taken when wefirst attacked the city. We slept in the house that night and earlythe next morning while it was still dark we ate breakfast and shortlywent out in trucks. The rumor was that we were going to Bonn andlater crossing the Rhine at the Remagen bridgehead that was now aboutthree weeks old.</p><p>We rode a long time and when we passed Bonn we realized wewere onno joyride. We crossed the Rhine on a pontoon bridge somewhere southof Bonn and north of Remagen. It was the 23rd of March (1945). Wedrove a few miles past the Rhine and detrucked. The country was veryrough and mountainous; there were very few towns. It was plain to seethat the enemy had not defended this land very hard or we never couldhave taken it. Our company went to its area on the side of a hill anddug in. We built covered holes to sleep in. Stricker had carried afeather bed along that we lined the hole with. It was the warmestfoxhole we ever made.</p><p>After we had completed our hole I rested and read part of apocketbook I had started at Cologne. The name of the book was <cite>AndThen There Was None</cite> . Later something happened that mademethink a lot about that title.</p><p>We slept that night in the holes with two men on guard. Thenextday Jones got some wonderful news that he was going to get a pass toEngland in a few days. Previously he had refused many passes to restcamps and even a pass to Paris. He would always tell us jokingly thathe was waiting for a good long pass. Now that he got one he evenrefused this one but the fellows talked him into going. Then he begansweating it out for fear he would get hit first.</p><p>The next day a few shells came in but none landed very close.Stricker and I took out across country and through a woods lookingfor deer but none did we find. I slept and read the rest of theday.</p><p>Early that night we moved out down a road and dug in on thesideof a hill. Stricker and I just dug a wide slit trench without a coverand slept but it was mighty cold. During the night shells came in andlanded pretty close but no one was hit. Some of the shells wereNebenlwefers(?). Their loud scream is enough to drive anyone crazy.In the morning we moved forward a few hundred yards to the top of abig hill that approached the proportions of a mountain. Most of usdug in except four who stayed in a room of a bombed-out house.</p><p>Jones had left that night on his pass and now I had the squad.Sgt. Holshouser became my assistant. A few shells landed very closebut luckily no one was hit. We ate a hot meal here.</p><p>When darkness came we moved forward in single file. Weadvancedabout 500 yards down the slope and dug in on the rear slope ofanother hill. Stricker and I built a good covered foxhole. I stoodguard the first half of the night and Stricker the last half. Mysquad stole a bunch of K-rations from a TD supply truck. We figuredthey could afford it. Around midnight a Jerry flack gun opened up atus. I could see the flash of the gun and reported it to the CP. Ifigured it was a self-propelled gun that came down a road and thendrove away.</p><p>At dawn we lulled around in the warm sunshine by our holes. Wefinally got a complete situation on our whereabouts and what we weregoing to do. The plan was this: At present we were waiting for the414th up ahead to reach a certain phase line. Then they were going toride on 3rd Armored tanks and move forward. We of the 415th wouldfollow behind the tanks and mop up pockets of resistance that thetanks bypassed. The main objective which was the 7th Corps' objectivewas the city of Atenkerchen where a one-time Nazi headquarters waslocated. On our left were the 8th and 1st Divisions, on our right wasour 413 Regiment. When we moved out the 2nd Battalion was going tolead, G Company was the leading company, and the 3rd Platoon theleading platoon. Vance picked the 3rd Squad for the leading squad; mysquad was really the point. I was thinking and hoping that I waspicked because I was capable and not because Vance was getting evenwith me for giving him a hard time. All I could do was stay alert andstay alive and try to keep my squad out of trouble. We now had aten-man squad. Lord had left at the last area. He cracked up when hegot two letters back that he had written to his two brothers. Theletters were stamped-Missing in Action. He was evacuated and nevercame back to the outfit. McDonald left with asthma and Dale Blairleft with a bad foot.</p><p>We were figuring on doing a lot of walking for awhile since wewere following tanks so we piled our packs in a stack for the supplytrailer to pick up. We stacked the packs by a barn and waited for theorder to move out. I was standing up by my hole and talking toStricker, Rutledge, and Lopez who were lying down. A shell came inover the hill so fast I didn't have time to even duck. It must havepassed about six feet directly over my head and exploded against thebarn about 25 yards away. That's when I first dove in the hole.Shrapnel didn't hit me because we were directly behind the explosionand shrapnel from a shell usually flies out to the side. The companyCP was in a house about 40 yards from the explosion. Small pieces ofshrapnel flew through the window and hit Capt. Milner in the throatand chest. He died a few minutes later. Vance was also hit in the legand was evacuated with another man from Cannon Company who was hit.It was such a freak hit that killed Capt. Milner that it was hard tobelieve he was gone.</p><p>Lt. Mauldin came around to my hole and was telling me abouttheaccident; he was in that room with Capt. Milner. I didn't knowexactly why Lt. Mauldin came to tell me about it. Officers alwayssend word to come see them, but I can guess. "Mack," a companyrunner, used to tell me Capt. Milner liked me and thought very highlyof me. No doubt it was because of that night in Holland when wecrossed the Mark River. Lt. Mauldin probably also knew what Capt.Milner thought of me. Maybe that is why Lt. Mauldin came to me ormaybe he was just a friendly guy.</p><p>G Company lost a great man that day, Capt. Milner wasrespectedeven by Terry Allen as a great leader and marvelous tactician. Iadmired the man for another reason. Capt. Milner was highly nervousand was often close to a battle fatigue case. But that didn't stophim from carrying out his duty as well as any man could do. It wasrumored that Capt. Milner didn't have to come back to the front afterhe went back with ulcers but he asked to be sent up. I never foundout if that was the case but I will always believe it. I mentionoften about different people being nervous and afraid. I like it tobe known that most of us were that way. It's hard to be calm when youthink you might die at any moment. Some just showed the strain morethan others but we all got the job done nevertheless. Of course therewere a few cowards around that should have been weeded out becausethey were just endangering the rest of us.</p><p>Fortunately for G Company we had an equally competent leaderinLt. Mauldin who soon made captain. After Vance was hit the order ofmarch was changed: the 2nd Platoon would lead with the 3rd in therear. Neanes took over again as platoon leader and Korn as platoonsergeant. In a way I was glad to see Vance go. Eventually he wouldhave probably been OK but as yet he wasn't combat wise and he couldhave gotten us into a good mess again like he already did at thatoutpost shelling. Neanes was no better but at least we could reasonwith him; he wasn't bullheaded like Vance.</p><p>About two hours after Capt. Milner was killed we moved outdown adirt road. We walked along secondary roads behind and to the right ofthe tank column that went down the main road. We acted as flanksecurity. We walked a very long time and got very hot. It was like ahot summer day. In one little village that we passed through thecivilians came out and filled a large shell hole in the road. Thatwas the first time German civilians ever came out to help us.</p><p>In one place we could see our armored column ahead racing downthemain road. The tanks were in the lead and supply trucks werefollowing. Enemy shells were falling along the road but no tanks werehit. Towards night we stopped and dug in. Stricker and I dug a verygood covered foxhole. A very large enemy shell landed in a housewhere I had just been getting wood for the roof of our hole. Theshell killed two GIs from another company.</p><p>We ate hot chow after dark and then slept with two men onguard inthe squad. At midnight we moved out and walked a ways and dug in onthe rear slope of another hill. Stricker and I dug another good holebecause we figured on being here until morning at least. We lined thehole with blankets that were taken from a nearby house. Near thathouse was a burning Jerry tank that had very recently been knockedout. We smelled a very peculiar odor that we knew came from theburning Jerries inside the tank.</p><p>We were wrong in our guess. After an hour's sleep we moved outagain and walked another long ways. We walked through a town and dugin on the rear slope of a hill just before daybreak. By this timeStricker and I were plenty disgusted so we dug a hole and put a strawcover on it just to keep warm. Then we slept on into the day. We hada hot noon meal. In the afternoon we sat and talked around our holes.Rigsby, who had been on a pass to Paris since Cologne, came back andtook over his 1st Squad-I was still leading the 3rd.</p><p>In the evening we pulled out on a long walk. We went on a roadthrough a very large and dense woods. Along the road were verymassive German artillery pieces, about 240 millimeter, pulled bygiant prime movers. They were in good condition and looked like ourtanks overran their guns before they had time to pull them back. Themore I saw of these big guns the better I liked it because it meantthat fewer shells would be thrown at us. We came out of the woods anddown a hill towards a town. Enemy mortar shells started falling inabout 100 yards to our right. We all scattered-I dove under a parkedtank. When the shelling ceased we got back on the road and continuedon our way. Varnadore and Berg hid in the same house and never cameback until the next day-I was burned up at them. Shortly we stoppedon a road and waited until about dark before moving out again. Thetanks hit a little resistance. When we started again we walked a longways into the night. Once we stopped for a short rest. A boy from FCompany got off the road and tripped a booby trap. He gave out aterrifying cry. Later we learned he was hit in the bowels and diedshortly after. That scream gave everyone a queer feeling.</p><p>Eventually we came to a little town and dug in on theoutskirts.Stricker and I no sooner got a den built when we moved to town into ahouse. The platoon crowded into a house and slept. I slept on adavenport. In four hours we had to move out of the house so anotherplatoon could get a chance at it. First I took a long drink of milkthe civilians had in a pail. We were always warned not to eat Germanfood for fear it was poisoned but as far as we knew there was never aproblem.</p><p>We moved into already dug holes behind some tanks and sleptsomemore until noon. We received PX rations, cigarettes, candy, and a fewbooks. The candy was popular brands of five cent candy bars. We eachgot one. I was always popular at such times; the guys wanted mycigarettes since I didn't smoke.</p><p>The tanks finally broke through the enemy line of resistanceandhad fairly smooth sailing. They overran their objective, Atenkerchen,and kept going. We could no longer catch them by walking so truckswere brought up and we drove after the tanks. We passed throughAtenkerchen. Once it was a town, now it was a heap of rubble; it paidthe price for housing the Nazi headquarters. Nearly every buildingwas torn down by bombs. Displaced people were walking and pushingcarts full of their belongings. They were walking in all differentdirections like they didn't know where to go.</p><p>Just before darkness fell the trucks stopped and we walked therest of the way into town. The town, as all towns were from here onin, was full of civilians. Our squad went to a house at the far endof town. We moved in with the civilians and took over a couple ofrooms. An hour or so later we ate chow and then prepared to sleep. Weslept about an hour and were awakened. We moved out walking.</p><p>We walked about two miles to another town. We knocked on thedoorof a house that our squad was to occupy. An old man came to a window.He wouldn't open the door so we broke it down and walked in. The oldman brought us some straw for the floor of a room and we went tosleep with one guard at the door. We ate breakfast in the morning andaround noon moved out in trucks. We rode until we came to a smalltown and then detrucked. It was getting dark as we waited in thestreet until we learned the situation. We were going to walk throughthe next two towns up the way and take Haeger, quite a small town. Wewalked down the road and approached the first town. Outside the townalong the road were about ten dead and bloated horses. Apparentlythey had been used for pulling artillery and were killed by bombingsome time ago. We went into the town and waited for F Company to gointo the next town up ahead. Some of us broke into a house to getwarm. The house had a butcher shop attached and there was all kindsof meat hanging up. We sure hated to leave it all behind. I found abucket of milk and really filled up on it. We moved out in one hourand came into the next town from the rear. We stopped for about tenminutes along a side street. Civilians came out of their houses towatch us and even brought us chairs. We moved through town and on toHaeger.</p><p>The entire battalion was in column. We also approached Haegerfromthe rear. When we were about 500 yards from the town we stopped on ahill and a patrol was sent into town to see if it was safe to comein. The patrol came back in about an hour and reported enemy tanks intown. They informed Battalion and the orders came back, "Take thetown." As we moved forward a sniper was shooting at us from the rightflank but he couldn't see us very well because of the darkness.</p><p>When the front of the column neared the town enemy machinegunsopened up on us and a burp gun commenced firing from the right. Wewere caught in a cross fire and things looked pretty bad. Everyonescattered but there was no place to hide; we were on a hill with nocover. The companies got all mixed and bunched up. I led my squad toone side and told them to stay there until I came back for them. Isearched around until I found Capt. Mauldin and he said to pull backto the last town. I got the squad and left that hot spot in a hurry.The whole battalion came back to reorganize except a couple of squadswho had already gotten into town. One of the squads was from ourcompany's 1st Platoon. One of the fellows had his head blow off by adirect hit from a tank-fired shell. In the cross fire that the wholebattalion was caught in only one man was wounded and that was amazingconsidering the amount of lead that was snapping around us. We madeour "strategic withdrawal" and set up an all-around defense in caseof an enemy counterattack. I slept for about an hour in a haybarn.</p><p>In the morning we moved into town meeting no resistancewhatsoever. The enemy tanks, estimated over ten, cleared out duringthe night. One knocked out tank was in the center of town. One of themost gruesome sights I have ever seen was a dead Jerry slumped over amotorcycle with his brains poured out of his head through his crackedskull. Apparently a shell landed on the back of his cycle as he wasdriving along and cut him up. Al took a picture of him. We marchedthrough the town to the other end. Half of the town was in goodcondition but the other half was destroyed by a recent bombing. Acivilian fire guard was busy trying to put out a fire that wasrapidly consuming a house. Civilians were all over the place.</p><p>This was the first town that we took that had stores withwindowdisplays. Apparently the stores were doing business the day before.We marched through to the bombed-out part of town and went intohouses. Here we got in some of the best looting we had ever seen. Theplace was just recently bombed out and everything was left in thehouses, only the people were gone. We couldn't carry much with us somost things were left there for other troops to take I suppose. Hoseycame in with a bunch of rusty rifles of all kinds and calibers thatwere left behind. Stricker carried one sniper rifle with him.</p><p>We ate a hot meal in the evening. That night I think I got anhour's sleep before we moved out once again. We got in waiting trucksand rode through the night. In the morning we arrived at a fairlylarge town. The only GIs in town were a tank crew with their tanksitting in the center of town. We searched the houses and found a fewJerry doctors and noncombat troops that were awaiting capture. Oursquad settled down in a pretty nice house. Some of us were outsidetalking when three men in civilian clothes came walking down thestreet. We paid no attention to them until they came to us. One ofthem could speak English and said, "We are German soldiers. We cameto surrender." He explained that they were told by their CO to go tothe hills and fight. They went to the hills and changed to civilianclothes so we wouldn't shoot at them and then came out.</p><p>We ate a hot meal here and before we could catch any sleep wemoved out again, this time walking. Our objective was a town 35 milesaway. No trucks were handy so we were going to walk it. After walkingabout two miles, trucks came up much to our relief. There were only afew trucks so it was going to be a shuttle march. Our platoon rodethe trucks first and were driven to within four miles of ourobjective. As we walked the remaining distance the trucks went backand picked up the other half of the company. We all reached the townat about the same time. The roads that we travelled here were filledwith displaced persons of all nationalities, French, Poles, Belgians,Italians, Russians, and about every other nationality possible. Theywere all heading to the rear and were very happy.</p><p>When we reached town our squad took a house on a hill. When wewere in the house a Jerry plane came over and bombed the highwayoutside of town knocking out a couple of jeeps. The plane was chasedoff by 50 caliber machine guns that opened up all over town. Sgt.Holshouser left us here. He had a few fractured bones in his footfrom walking. We were all so dead tired we could hardly keep our eyesopen so we forgot about the guard and fell asleep. We were awakenedafter daylight by the runners; chow was ready.</p><p>We ate breakfast and shortly after moved out. One of our tankshadbeen knocked out by a Jerry SP that was hiding in the hillssomewhere. It was our company's job to find the SP and the 3rdPlatoon was in the lead. Rigsby's squad went up a mountain on oneside of the road and the rest of us went up a wooded mountain on theother side of the road. We labored up the mountain and then stoppednear the top. Lt. Mauldin came up bringing the rest of the company.They had just received information that there were a couple of tankson the other side of the mountain. We moved down the wooded slope ofthe mountain. Lt. Col. Deane, the battalion commander, came up andled the column. A small town was in the valley that now became ourobjective. To get to the town we had to go across a couple of hundredyards of open country. With Col. Deane in the lead we spread out andran across the open ground and into the town. Col. Deane was one ofthe first ones in town and a couple of minutes later was the first tofire at a Jerry. A German kid came running up to us and said therewere a couple of tanks in town. My squad was split up between acouple of bazooka teams so I was sort of on my own. As we movedfurther into town we saw two enemy tanks retreating out with Jerryinfantrymen walking along.</p><p>The battle commenced. The bazooka teams poured rounds at thetanksand finally stopped one at the edge of town. Stricker took off aftera tank down a road firing a bazooka, but he didn't score a hit. Spudand I ran down a street to try and reach the end of town and cut offthe retreating Jerries. A machine gun opened up on us and we dove forthe ditch and then crawled to safety. Neanes, Spud, and I then workedaround some buildings. A burp gun opened up on us from a hill and onebullet went through the wall between Neanes' and my heads. It missedus both by a foot. We ducked and fired back. The remaining Jerry tankwithdrew out of town and the Jerries got away. With all that leadflying around no one was hit in the entire battle. Everybody wastalking about the close misses they had.</p><p>Things quieted down as one of our tanks pulled up, parked on ahill, and sent some rounds after the retreating tank. It must havehit the tank because it never moved again. But first it let threerounds fly at our tank and set it on fire. The tank was knocked outbut no one was hurt. An artillery OP was set up in a house where a FOdirected the fire from. The Jerries sent a round into the OP andwounded the FO and Stuart, our communication helper. Those were theonly casualties in the entire battle.</p><p>I spent the next couple of hours rounding up my squad that wasscattered all over town. We went into a building and ate some Jerrycake that was made for Easter we later learned. A couple of fellowstold an interesting story.</p><p>They had gotten to the end house of town and saw a Negrocrawlingthough the grass to them. When he got to the house he explained whathe was doing there. He was a truckdriver riding in a convoy down themain road. He and another truckdriver got lost from the convoy andwent up the side road into this town. A Jerry tank knocked out bothtrucks and killed the other driver. The Negro fell in a ditch andplayed possum. The Jerry tankers came up and kicked him but when hedidn't move they walked away. The Jerries looted his truck and tookrations and blankets and then left. The Negro lay in the ditch allday until we took the town. He was half frozen but mighty happy to bealive.</p><p>Towards evening Neanes, Korn, Rigsby, and I were looking for agood outpost for the night. I happened to look down the road and sawthree Jerry tanks parked on the road about a hundred yards apartfacing me. The last one could just be seen on the crest of the hillso there could have been more behind. I ran back full speed and toldLt. Mauldin about it. We figured the Jerries were going tocounterattack. They got the artillery pounding the road as darknessbegan hiding the tanks. That night we put an all-around protectionaround the town but nothing happened. Early in the dark hours ofmorning another division pushed through town and soon we were rearechelon.</p><p>In the morning trucks came and carried us away. I got apackagefrom home and carried it with me. We detrucked and then walked aboutthree miles up a winding dirt road and I was really tired carryingthat package. We stopped in a town and moved into houses with thecivilians. We rested the remaining part of the day and at night ourplatoon rode TDs to a building out in open country. Our division hadsurrounded a lot of Jerries and went out there to keep the Jerriesfrom infiltrating our lines and getting out of the pocket. We set upa couple of OPs and didn't get much sleep. Sgt. Simone joined oursquad here.</p><p>In the morning we moved back to town and then the entirecompanymoved west to another town. We were pushing the Jerries into atighter pocket. In this town our squad stayed in the end buildings inthe rear of town. The civilians here were very nice to us and gave usan Easter cake, then we stole two more. Stricker got a swellpearl-handled pistol from the civilians. We slept there that nightand in the morning walked to the next town up the line. Here werelieved F Company.</p><p>We stayed in one house during the day and moved to another oneatnight where we stood OP guard. We found preserved fruit and meat andfresh milk so we had quite a feast. The next day we rested and lootedand some of the fellows fraternized with some Polish and Germangirls. Our platoon also went on a combat patrol through a woods. Whenenemy shells fell on us we turned around and came back. No one washit.</p><p>That night we stood OP in a hayloft and the next day moved outintrucks. We travelled north around Kassel. It was now that the 104thand 3rd Armored closed up the Rhine pocket to trap a couple of Germanarmies.</p><p>In the evening we stopped in a town where we spent the night.Rigsby's and my squads stayed in the same house so we had an easyguard. I got about ten letters; one was from George McKissock. He wasgetting along fine in the hospital. I wrote him a letter but he neverreceived it. I stayed up until two in the morning writingletters.</p><p>In the morning after chow we pulled out again in trucks. Westayedon country roads and finally stopped in a little town. We occupied ahouse with tankers. Here a good thing happened to our platoon. Lt.McDonald became our platoon leader. He was originally with F Companybut he went to the hospital and came back to G Company. He was aswell guy and everyone liked him right away. That night we stood atOP guard.</p><p>In the morning we pushed off to clear a large woods abouteightmiles long which meant about twelve miles of walking. All morning wewalked through valleys, over hills, around fields, and through thickwoods. I guess we were looking for bypassed Jerries. At noon we cameto a sizeable town occupied by another division. We ate a K-ration intown and then pushed off through the woods. By evening we were alldead tired and mighty glad to see our objective: the Weser River.That night we stayed in the woods without digging foxholes. Strickerand I borrowed a comforter from a medic and then crowded into asleeping bag. We slept reasonably warm. In the morning we atebreakfast and then walked back to a highway and waited for trucks. Webuilt fires to keep warm while we waited. The trucks finally came atnoon. We crossed the river on a pontoon bridge that was erected asideof a bridge that was blown out by retreating Jerries. It was a verypretty, peaceful river. We drove along the river for awhile and thenheaded west and soon detrucked.</p><p>While the rest of the company moved out to take a town ourplatoonstayed back and waited for TDs to come; we were going to ride theminto town. After an hour the TDs came and five men jumped on eachone. We moved up to a little town and waited for a couple of hours.By this time it was getting dark and we were getting cold. We wentinto a house to get warm. The house was occupied by a kitchen crew ofanother outfit. We were all very hungry and didn't have any rationsso we "borrowed" some K-rations from a box in the hall. We ate andslept a little. In the night we moved out again on the TDs. Thereseemed to be a lot of confusion up ahead. We were going across muddyground and some tanks got stuck. After we almost froze to death theTD turned around and came back to the same town. We went back to ourhouse. In the morning the TD I was riding went out to pull a tank outof a mudhole and then followed the rest of the TDs around a main roadinto the town that we were trying to reach all night. The rest of ourcompany was already here. They walked in last night after circlingall over the countryside looking for it.</p><p>We ate breakfast and then I went around town looking for ahouseto stay in. The town was crowded, but I finally found a couple ofrooms and brought the squad up. At this town Neanes left us forawhile to take over the 2nd Platoon while Sgt. Mahl went back to gethis commission.</p><p>We just settled down to get some sleep when we moved outagain. Wewalked to another small town about a mile away. My squad took over asmall house and at last we got some rest. I remember this townparticularly for the lousy chow we were getting. We were moving toofast for the supplies to catch up so all we had to eat was C-rationstew and German potatoes. About everyone was getting sick.</p><p>In the evening some of the fellows started playing with thelittlekids, chasing them and stuff. The kids got a big kick out of it whilethe older people looked on, at first very solemn faced, but then theytoo laughed and the atmosphere changed. Apparently the peoplerealized that we weren't as bad as the Nazi propaganda had made thembelieve. The civilians said that ten soldiers were left to defend thetown but the people laughed at them and they cleared out before wecame.</p><p>In the morning we moved out in trucks. We stopped at the edgeof awoods. Our job was to clear the woods. There was a road through thewoods that we followed all the way. It was a very hot day and most ofthe fellows were sick from the lousy food so it was a pretty tougheight miles. I made it in fine shape because I never got sick.</p><p>Finally we came to a small town and we crowded into a house.Thecivilians almost had a fit with so many GIs moving in. We slept thereand ate chow in the morning. We again moved out in trucks and soonstopped in another small town. I split my squad up in two houses.Lopez, Solberg, Spud, and I stayed in one room of a house. Thecivilians were very nice to us. One boy about 17 years old couldspeak a little English so we got along fine. They even served uscoffee, bread, and jam a couple of times. That day and night wemaintained an OP on a hilltop. Stricker became friends with a verypretty girl in the house he stayed in. She made him promise to writeto her. We joked that the promise was as solid as the Nazi army. Allthe civilians were very friendly to the GIs.</p><p>The next day we moved out in trucks to another town. Wearrived inthe town just at dark and we had trouble getting the civilians out ofa room for us to stay in. We had to man an OP at the end of town.Berg and I went out from ten to twelve and dug a hole. In the morningwe ate and started out again in trucks.</p><p>We pulled into another town and our entire platoon went intoonehouse. On top of a high hill we had to man four two-man OPs. It wasrather foolish I thought but "who were we to reason why?" We stood OPall that night and the next day pulled out walking.</p><p>We walked to another town only a mile away. My squad took overacouple of rooms in an apartment house and stood guard at night infront of the house.</p><p>In the morning we moved out in trucks. We travelled a longwaysdown main highways. In one place the convoy stopped on a main road inopen country; there was some confusion up ahead. Another convoy thatwas behind us became impatient and pulled up along side of us.Another convoy behind came up on the other side. Then an empty truckconvoy came along heading back to the rear so that made four columnsof trucks, Jeeps, and artillery pieces. What a slaughter that wouldhave been if the Jerries had an air force. We finally pulled out asit was getting dark and travelled long into the night. We almostfroze on that truck. We crossed a river on a pontoon bridge and theconvoy got split up. Whoever was leading took off like a big bird andthe trucks following couldn't tell which way to go. We finally cameinto a small town and holed up for the remainder of the night. Laterwe learned we travelled a long ways through enemy territory thatnight. We were lucky we didn't have the heck knocked out of us byJerry tanks.</p><p>Lt. Mack and I went into a large building looking for a placetohouse the platoon. We walked in unlocked doors and entered a roomwhere a man was sitting at a desk. When we came in he got up andexplained in very poor English that he was a doctor and this was ahospital. He had a flashlight and he told me to follow him; he wantedto find another doctor that could speak better English. We went downa stairway and right into an operating room where a doctor wasoperating on a man with a gash in his back. When he found the man hewas looking for we came back upstairs. This man could speak Englishfairly well. He said they had a whole room full of German soldiersthat had been brought in from Halle. (At this time the 415th regimentwas fighting in Halle.) He showed us some American rations that weregiven to them by our Red Cross. Lt. Mack and I left them to theirmiseries and went out looking for another place to stay. My squadmoved into a couple of houses and slept the remainder of the night.In the morning we had to get up early. The civilians in our housegave us some cake and coffee before we left.</p><p>We got in trucks and went to the place where we originallyweresupposed to go. It was a fairly large town but I just can't rememberthe name of it. Our squad went into a large house where the peoplewere very unfriendly. They took every movable object out of the roomwe stayed in. We asked for blankets and they wouldn't give us any.Rutledge got mad and slammed his BAR on the floor and almost scaredthe people to death. They must have gone to their Burgermeister orsomething because in a couple of hours they changed their tune. Theywere willing to give us anything we asked for.</p><p>When we got to talking to the people we heard that one oftheirmen was a tanker on the Russian front until he was wounded. Thatexplained why they were so hostile to us at first. I guess we showedthem that all soldiers weren't like the Russians and Germans.</p><p>We manned a three-man OP at the end of town during the day.Rutledge, Spud, and I went on OP for three hours around noon. I tooka walk around the countryside looking for rabbits but didn't see any.Spud shot at one in an open field and had the rabbit zigzagging allover the place-it got away.</p><p>I wrote a letter home from here and told Mom not to worrybecauseI was in very little danger. What a gross understatement that provedto be. I got about one hour's sleep and was awakened to go to the CP.We got the plans for an attack on a town named Sandersdorf wherethere was believed to be some Jerries. We moved out about one o'clockin the morning. We marched in a column of twos with E Company in thelead. We marched down the road for a ways and then cut off andcircled around a town along a woods. We came across an open field andheaded straight for Sandersdorf.</p><p>When the front of the column reached the entrance to town,machineguns and burp guns opened up on us. We all hit the ground which wasflat as a pancake. In a little bit most of the fellows starteddigging in. I was carrying a little blanket so I spread this on thecold ground and lay down on it. I fell asleep almost instantly whileeverybody else continued to dig in. Later the fellows had a big laughabout that, falling asleep in the middle of a battlefield. I had somany close misses up to then I guess I was feeling invincible-adangerous thing to do. Soon E Company pushed into town and wescattered out a little and dug in as daylight broke. We were stillbeing fired at so we dug in from a prone position.</p><p>Later in the morning our platoon pulled out to the rear andwentto a town about two miles across open country. We waited to ride ontanks into Sandersdorf. While we were waiting by the side of theroad, Berg shot himself through the foot just as Capt. Wrench(?), thebattalion medical officer came down the road in a jeep. No one knewif he shot himself purposely or not, we could only guess. To me hecertainly didn't show the symptoms of fatigue and deterioration thatI saw in Demopulos.</p><p>We climbed on the tanks and were taken to a woods outside ofSandersdorf. Here we waited for awhile, then riding the tanks, wentinto town. At the entrance to town we passed three dead GIs and threedead Germans. The GIs were from E Company and were killed last night.That gave us all a queer feeling seeing those dead men. E Company hadseven men killed here. When we entered town we jumped off the tanksand went into buildings. We found that E Company had taken only avery small section of town. With tank support we soon pulled out toenlarge that section. Our platoon advanced down a street towards theend of town. One of our tanks came down the center of the street aswe ducked around buildings and fences along the street. The tankwould advance a few yards, fire into different buildings and thenmove ahead again. In a driveway we found two dead Jerries and anotherone that was still breathing but wounded in the leg and shoulder bybullets. I removed a 25 pistol and a knife from this one's pocket andthe watch from his wrist, then I started cutting his pants to fix hiswound. I had to move on to lead my squad so I called on Gonzales totake care of him.</p><p>We moved to the end of town and reached a factory but onlyfoundone very meek Jerry hiding. Apparently the Jerries were in the otherend of town and that suited us just fine. We set up an OP at the endof the factory guarding the left flank and then looked for a house tostay in. But then we were alerted because E Company was beingcounterattacked by the enemy. My whole squad went to the factorywhere we set up four OPs and remained there all night. It was a toughnight.</p><p>In the morning we moved into a house but kept a two-man OP atthefactory. We finally caught up on our sleep a bit. E Company by thistime repulsed six counterattacks and suffered a lot of casualties.Jerries kept climbing over fences, around buildings, and sneaking upon them.</p><p>The next night we stood OP with the machine gun crews so mysquadhad a fair amount of sleep. In the morning chow was brought up in ajeep-bread, jam, and cake. Around the factory were a lot of displacedpersons, mostly laborers and most from Russia. We talked to themwhile we were on OP. Most of the time we just rested and ateK-rations which were now abundant. In the afternoon my squad waspicked to run a patrol down a road to our right and contact a FCompany patrol. F Company was supposed to be in a town to our right.I led the squad down the road well dispersed. At the halfway pointwhere F Company was supposed to meet us I stopped the squad and toldthem to take cover. Then Stricker and I went on ahead to within 200yards of the town. We could see civilians walking around town but noGIs. I didn't like the looks of things so we came back to the squad.A civilian came riding down the road on a bicycle. Stricker and Istopped him and asked where he was going. He said to a town up theway. We told him to turn around because civilians weren't allowedthrough battle lines.</p><p>He turned around and started back when we heard a shot and hehitthe ground. He limped over to a little shack and Stricker and I ranover to him. He was shot through the stomach. We told him we would goback and bring help, which we did. We found a civilian nurse and shegot some civilians with a litter and brought him in. We never didfigure out where the shot came from and why they shot the civilianand not Stricker and me who made just as good a target. I reported toLt. Mack and he told me to go to the company CP and tell Lt. Mauldinabout the patrol. Capt. Mauldin said that F Company probably didn'tmeet us because they were bombed and strafed by planes. I think therewas some mistake in what town F Company was in because the town weapproached certainly wasn't bombed.</p><p>In the evening we got the dope on the coming attack. Aroundtwo inthe morning we were going to push off for a factory after a 15 minuteartillery barrage. Third Platoon was in reserve so everyone feltpretty good.</p><p>That evening I got some tankers to stand our OP for us so wecouldall get some sleep before the attack. Although we were a bit nervouswe slept anyway. I awoke at just the right time which I seem to havea knack for doing. We got our equipment out and moved down the roadwith Lt. Mack in the lead. The other two squads joined us at theirhouses and we moved toward a group of buildings that we were supposedto stay in while the rest of the company moved on to take the factory700 yards across an open field.</p><p>As we walked down a street our artillery shells were whistlingover us. They seemed to be landing awfully close but I thoughtnothing of it. We turned right around a corner and then were justabout in front of the houses we were supposed to occupy. Thendisaster struck. Two of our own 105 shells landed on us, one landedabout a yard from the center of my squad and the other about tenyards in front of our column. It seemed to me everyone was crying inpain. The first thing I did was jerk off some of my equipment so Icould move around better. Rutledge said, "I've been hit in the leg,Dean." I saw he was walking so I told him to go to a basement andtake care of himself while I took care of some of the more needy. AnH Company medic came out of a house and we carried Solberg down in abasement. He was hit in 15 places and was moaning in pain.</p><p>I left the medic to take care of Solberg and went outsideagain.Someone had already taken the rest of the wounded into otherbasements. Lopez was lying on the pavement. I checked his pulse andhe was dead. Apparently he was hit in the mouth; he must have diedinstantly. Spud Peeler was lying behind Lopez also dead. His legswere cut off and he too must have died instantly from shock. I wentinto a cellar and found Gonzales taking care of more wounded.Varnadore was lying on the floor with both legs almost cut off and hewas crying in pain. Sgt. Simone was lying on a cot also screaming inpain. He was hit in a few places. The worst was his arm which hemight have lost later. Callen(?) was taking care of him.</p><p>Stricker was sitting on a bed, a horrible sight. His cheek wascutwide open and was bleeding profusely. He just sat there with his headin his hands and blood flowing out at an amazing rate. I knew if Icouldn't slow the rate of blood flow he wouldn't have a chance ofliving. I attempted to bandage the gaping hole but each time I gotclose to slowing the flow of blood Stricker would tear it off. Iguess the blood would back up in his throat and he couldn't breath. Itried to tell him what was going on and try to keep the bandage on asmuch as possible to slow the flow of blood or he wouldn't make it.This seemed to work and the blood flow slowed. Stricker couldn't talkbecause his tongue was cut but I managed to make out that he wantedmorphine so I got Gonzales to give him an injection. Gonzales himselfwas a sad case. Instead of taking care of the desperate cases first,like Stricker, to keep them alive, he was putting bandages on minorwounds and not saying a word. He must have been in some kind ofmental state. He was the medic and all I knew about wounds wasapplying a Band-Aid to a cut finger. (I saw Don Stricker after thewar. He had a scar from forehead to chin across his cheek. It didn'tseem to detract from his normal handsome features. In fact, in theseventies body scars became quite the rage, a sex symbol orsomething. People were pasting them on their face and bodies. Iwonder what Don thought of that. Don and I never talked about thatnight so I never found out if he knew what I did for him, not that itmatters. Some 20 years after the war I was in Spain watching abullfight. At the end the bull was supposed to fall over dead butinstead it just stood there with a huge flow of blood gushing out ofits mouth and nostrils. I thought of Stricker and I wasmiserable.)</p><p>Varnadore was fully conscious and was yelling in pain. Hesaid,"It was our own artillery, wasn't it Dean?" I said, "Yes Varn, italways is." I was so mad at our artillery for all the damage theywere doing. I felt they should be forced to come look at thesescreaming guys. If those idiots would put their forward observer inthe front lines this would never happen. Varnadore said, "Oh whydidn't I hit the ground?" I said, "It wouldn't have done any good,Varn." I could stand it no more and started heading out to find morewounded. Varnadore saw me leaving and cried, "Don't leave me, Dean."I said, "I have to help some other fellows but I'll be right back."When I did get back in a little while Varn was gone-and then I wassorry I left. His legs were so badly mangled they weren't bleeding sohe must have died in shock-maybe if I had stayed. . .</p><p>I went out in the street. The artillery barrage had ceased andeverything was quiet. I could see the bodies of Spud and Lopez lyingin the street. I went to another house and found Neanes andBullus-both had been hit in the legs. Someone had already patchedthem up. In another house Rigsby was being worked on. He had been hitin a few places, the worst was a chest gash. They said he wascheerful. He was out of the war. <font color="#7f0000"><i>(Iwent tosee him after the war. I found him living in a shack with his motherin the southern Appalachian Mountains. The shack was made of thinboard walls and the room contained one table and three chairs. Thiswas Appalachian poverty at its best. His mother was a cheerful, tinyperson. Beside 6'3" lumbering Rigsby they made quite a pair. Icouldn't figure out if Rigsby remembered me for sure. He didn't talkmuch. During the war it was rumored he was a moonshiner back home andmaybe now he still was and suspected me of being arevenuer.)</i></font></p><p>Back out in the street I realized how lucky I was. Two men infront of me and eight men behind were hit, my entire squad. Lopez,directly behind me was killed, then Stricker who was wounded, andthen came Spud and Varnadore both killed. Besides my squad, more menwere hit in the squad ahead and behind ours. We were in the center ofthe massacre. Undoubtedly I was partly saved by the shrapnel hittingother fellows before it got to me but it doesn't explain how Lopez,the smallest guy in the company, got hit walking between tallStricker and me.</p><p>Later I found shrapnel had scratched my cheek and put a fairlylarge hole in my pant leg but didn't touch my leg. A medic said hewould put me in for a Purple Heart and I said, "No thanks, I'll waitfor the big one." I couldn't accept a medal for a scratch while mysquad was annihilated.</p><p>I found Lt. Mack who had ducked into a house and then patchedupNeanes and Bullus. He told me to go to the company CP that was on thenext street and explain the situation to them.</p><p>I found the CP in a nice warm basement covered with straw andblankets. Lt. Peake was in charge here while Capt. Mauldin wasleading the attack on the factory. I walked in on Lt. Peake and fouror five GIs all in very clean and neat clothes. I stood there coveredwith dirt and splattered with Stricker's blood and explained what hadhappened. I was hoping someone would take pity on me and I'd be askedto sit and rest awhile in this cozy basement but all I got was anorder from Lt. Peake to round up the rest of the company and head forthe factory where Capt. Mauldin ran into resistance and needed help.I felt like saying, "Why me, I'm just a kid, corporal. There must besome officers around here that should be doing this." But of course Ididn't; I probably wouldn't have stayed anyway.</p><p>I went out and started rounding up the guys. Al Prokopiac andthree others couldn't be found. They were hiding in cellarssomewhere. Maxwell was all shaken up and couldn't go on so that leftabout ten of us to go to the factory. We got some ammunition roundsand took off across the 700 yards of open country. We came to awooden fence, walked down this to an opening, and went into thefactory building that had already been taken by our company. We putguards on all the entrances and waited for daylight which was alreadybreaking. The rest of the company was in other buildings of thefactory.</p><p>When it was light, Greer and I went to another building andlookedout across the open field that we came across last night. Jerrieswere dug in around a flack gun. They still didn't know we were in thefactory behind them. The FO had also spotted them and was directingartillery fire on them. Every once in a while a Jerry would getfrightened out of his hole by a close shell burst and run like mad toa nearby hill. As they ran across open ground about a dozen of usfired and hit every one. Later they stopped the artillery and senttwo civilians out with a white flag to talk the Jerries intosurrendering. They were all very anxious to give up and came runningout of their holes. There were about ten of them. We took them to anair-raid shelter where we had a lot of other prisoners.</p><p>I ran into Bud Urmetz here (a fellow Clevelander) and he said,"Boy, am I glad to see you." I said, "Me too. It looks like we madeit this far." But I was thinking of my squad that didn't make it. Iworked so hard to keep them out of harm's way and did so almost tothe end when our artillery ended it all. I saw more GIs killed by ourown artillery than by Jerries. This was the fourth and last time ithappened. The Germans must have thought we were some kind of fearlesssoldiers to dump the artillery on ourselves as we went on attack.</p><p>Lt. Peake came up later in the day and said Varnadore died intheaid station. I didn't think this was accurate. I think he died inthat cellar. The medics that came for the wounded probably askedGonzales who to take and my guess is Gonzales told them to take Varnalong with the rest. Gonzales by this time was so far out of it hewouldn't have known who was alive or dead. Stricker, they said, wouldbe OK and that made me feel better.</p><p>Coming back to the fight, things cooled down after the Jerriessurrendered. Bud, Greer, and I looked around the factory buildingsand found a large room full of showers. We hesitated a little andthen took off our clothes and showered. While we were washing enemyrifle fire opened up nearby. We didn't know what to do so Bud wentand locked the door and we continued our showers. We finished andwent back to the rest of the company.</p><p>We learned that Jerries were counterattacking our right flank.Ourplatoon went to reinforce the 2nd who already had one man killed(incidentally the last man to die in the company). Jerries werecreeping up through the grass and our troops would blaze away atthem. They killed quite a few Jerries. By the time our platoonarrived most of the fighting was over.</p><p>I stayed in a house with Ralston. We found some cannedcherriesand ate a lot of them. I grabbed an hour's sleep before we moved out.It was evening now as we moved forward into Bitterfield. There was aJerry aid truck by the road so I jumped into it and drove alongsidethe column until they turned off the road. We went only a short waysto some large buildings where we holed up for the night.</p><p>By this time everyone in the company had heard about the squadleader without a squad. It was nothing to be proud of. Maxwell cameby-he was back together again and said, "Well Dean, the war's overfor you." I didn't know what he meant and he said, "Anyone that couldcome through that barrage without a scratch must be leading a charmedlife, you'll never be hit now." I said, "I don't know Jack, I'm stillwaiting for the big one."</p><p>The house we stayed in was a regular mansion. The lights,radio,and phones were still working. We had music on all night and evenheard the news broadcast. The cellar was stacked with food of allkinds, even such things as cream and oatmeal. We had a real feast.There was a lot of liquor and champagne. Most everyone got prettyhigh.</p><p>During the night we had an OP down the street a ways. The 2ndPlatoon had an OP near ours. While on guard I talked to a fellow inthe other OP and he said Bulinsky was hit in the head with a bulletwhile on patrol. He was going to be OK though. He was the fellow whoback in Holland said, "It's too late in the war to get killed now."He was the last man in the company to be wounded. His life was sparedby his steel helmet which slowed down the bullet just enough so itlodged in his head instead of going through.</p><p>In the evening we moved through a large factory area. Peoplewerecoming to work as we searched out the buildings. When they saw usthey all gathered around and went wild with joy. This was a giantairplane and explosive factory that was entirely overlooked by ourbombers. Airplane propellers and H2SO4 acid were piled all over theplace.</p><p>We stopped awhile as a sniper kept firing at us but no one washit. After awhile we moved a few hundred yards to our left and theentire company moved into a group of buildings.</p><p><font color="#7f0000"><i>(This wasn'twritten in the diary but Ithink it was at this place that the following incident occurred. JakeMauldin, at the 50th anniversary in Minneapolis mentioned about a mancoming down from battalion headquarters. He said stories had beenfiltering back to headquarters about a certain squad led by acorporal that had been accomplishing some outstanding things and theysent him down to write it up. I happened to overhear the man talkingto Capt. Mauldin and knew he was talking about my squad. I broke inand said disgustedly, "There's nothing to write about, the squad waswiped out two nights ago," and walked out on him. At least I think itwent something like that. Jake I'm sure remembers it better. I neverthought about it for 50 years until Jake jogged my memory. Maybe Ishould have talked to the man. It would have been an interestingstory to send to the wounded squad members in the hospital since theywere the ones that made it happen and we might have been cited formedals. But at the time I was a very angry, bitter, young man andjust wasn't thinking or maybe I was and didn't want amedal.)</i></font></p><p>Soon we were told that the 3rd Battalion had moved intoBitterfield from the right flank and took the town. We had nothing toworry about anymore. That evening Rhodes came up with the chow andbecame platoon sergeant. A replacement also came, Pacheco. We didn'tknow it at the time but the war was over for us as far as thefighting went. That night we were told to disregard burp gun firefrom the rear; the workers were shooting up the German bosses thatused to give them a hard time. We heard the fire and it was music toour ears. In the morning we moved out in trucks to Dobern, a littletown near the Mulde River that F Company had taken the daybefore.</p><p>Since my squad was gone, I had been hanging around withRalston'ssquad. We moved into a pretty nice house. At night we had an OPbeside the house and in the daytime in an upstairs window. We spottedsome Jerries messing around on the other side of the river and gotour company mortars and then the 4.2 mortars that were nearby on thetarget. We could see that some of them were hit. They threw a lot ofwhite phosphorus on them and we observed no more activity after that.In a couple more days we were not allowed to fire anymore.</p><p>All along the front Jerries were swimming across the river andsurrendering to the Americans to get away from the Russians who nowwere on the Elbe River 24 miles away. Yes, it looked like the war wasover for us but we didn't want to get too excited; fighting was stillgoing on south of us.</p><p>There was a little pond in back of our house where we wentboatingand fishing with grenades. One day Maxwell and I went swimming andalmost froze.</p><p>The last day we were in this town Sergeants Lowe, Thompson,andJones came back. Brussard and McKissock came back also. I wassupposed to get the new squad that was formed but now that all thesestaff sergeants came back I was put in as assistant to Lowe, thesergeant I least respected. What a kick in the pants that was. But Ididn't complain, I was lucky to be alive and unscared and that is allI wanted from this war anyway. If they would have told me to go backto be an inconspicuous rifleman I would have accepted that too.</p><p>A day after everyone came back we walked to a little town acoupleof miles away and slept there for the night. I stole a ten gallonpail of milk that was set out in the center of town to be picked upby the dairy.</p><p>In the evening we moved out in trucks. We went a long ways inasoutherly direction and came to a little town that was occupied bythe 69th Division. The Russians were in the next town west of here.Our squad moved into a school building. We slept on the floor thatnight and the next day moved out in trucks. This time we went toBrandis east of Leipzig. Our job was to quell any riots that mightoccur in Leipzig.</p><p>We stayed in a good house and life was very easy. They startedatraining schedule that didn't amount to much. One day I went to thedentist to have an aching tooth filled. He did a lousy job and thefilling dropped out later. While I was waiting for the dentist alittle boy was brought in on a stretcher by civilians. He had bothhands blown off at the wrists. He hit a grenade with a hammer. Hestood up and held his arms out to the medics. He didn't talk. Hedidn't cry. But his eyes were pleading, "Please, put my hands backtogether." The medics patched him up and took him away in anambulance. I thought I was through seeing the gore of war and thenthis happened.</p><p>After about a week we moved to Dessau where we stayed quite afewweeks. (There is not much point in continuing with this story. Thewar was over in Europe and the 104th Division was getting ready to goback to the States. We knew if General Terry Allen had his way wewould be sent to the Pacific. He would have killed us all, not onpurpose of course. Fortunately, Truman dropped the A-bombs while wewere on furlough and we were discharged in California. The diarycontinues all the way to discharge and home. There is one thing thathappened on the boat that is worthy of note.)</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h4><a name="July5_1945"></a>July 5th, 1945,Thursday</h4><p>Most of the day the sea was calm although the sky was cloudy.Ispent the day reading and writing.</p><p>Today someone in E Company accidently shot another fellow withapistol. The bullet went through his arm and into his kidneys. Hischances of living are very slim. No one was supposed to be carryingammo so the boy that shot the pistol is in plenty of trouble.Everybody in the 2nd Battalion had to sign a paper saying he carriedno ammo. If the boy dies they will probably make a search andcourt-martial anyone found with ammo.</p><p>Towards evening a strong wind blew up. The sea became rocky.Theboat is tipping quite a bit now as I am going to bed.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h4><b><a name="July10_1945"></a>July10, 1945, Tuesday</b></h4><p>Today a very sad thing happened aboard the good ship JohnEricson.Henderson, the boy that was accidently shot five days ago, diedtoday. Services were given over the PA system by a chaplain. Aftergoing through two months of combat without getting hurt, he gets 500miles from home then dies. It's a very sad tale.</p><p>The water continued to be calm and the weather warm. We shouldbein New York tomorrow afternoon.</p><p><a href="#TOC">&lt;&lt;</a></p><h4>End of diary</h4><p>Somewhere along the way I was given a squad in another platoonandpromoted to sergeant and then to staff sergeant. I guess someone waslooking out for me; I never knew who.</p><p>Not mentioned in the diary were the medals I received. I guessIwasn't that impressed with them at the time. I felt you had to belucky to stay alive to receive a medal and not necessarily forbravery alone. I received a Bronze Medal for that night in Hollandwhen I volunteered for a solo patrol. That was quite a surprisebecause the medal came through after Capt. Milner died and he and Iwere the only ones that knew about the patrol. He must have writtenthe citation himself. I received an Oak Leaf Cluster to the BronzeStar sometime later and I don't remember what it was for. My housewas robbed some 20 years later and the medals and citations were alltaken.</p><p>I didn't receive the Purple Heart because, fortunately, thebigone never came. I heard I was one of five in our original company of120 men that wasn't killed or wounded. My old girlfriend that dumpedme during combat (she married a Marine) said she understoodcompletely why I survived-I wasn't a true believer so He was delayingmy demise until I was. My comment was, "If that's the way it works Ithink I'll keep believing the same way for awhile." So far it's stillworking.</p><p>Another medal I received was the French Croix de Guerre. Afterthefighting the French Government gave some to the 104th to be presentedto certain GIs. I was very proud of that medal because I had to havebeen chosen by somebody up there who appreciated my efforts.</p><p>Enough of these ramblings.</p><p>The End</p><p>This text is not returnable. Please put it in your atticsomewhere. Maybe some future generation will read it and either thinkwe were pretty brave for what we did for our country or just stupid.Since we know what the present generation thinks because they electeda draft-dodging president, we will just have to hope for futuregenerations to see things the way we did.</p><p>Dean Svec</p></body></html>
