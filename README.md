# knowsoft Orignial Website
Once upon a time in galaxy... you get the idea

This is the original Knowlegdge Software Website developed to peddle my wares when the InterWeb was young. 
Stardards changed every week and access to these standards wasn't easy and still in flux.  Nevertheless there
may be some value in the reto-features.

At various times the site was hosted on old unix (yes, unix) servers, an Mac Centris 650 in my basement, and later
hosted on a relatively modern server somewhere in the world.

Javascript was cowboy code as it needed a host of 'sepcial fixes' for every new browser that cropped up.
I have leftover experimetnts from cgi-bin services in perl, applescript, and eventually python (when it was just a
little fingerling, but just as deadly).

Mixed in to this site is the start of my academic development as I turned to teaching.
