<h2 align="center">Scatter Plot and Regression Applet</h2>

<p>You can create a fit to a set of data values typed into the x
and y columns. If using Excel (not the best for scientific graphing) is
not your cup of tea and you can't get the graphs from you calculator in
a printed form then just use this applet and print the screen. If you
are really clever you can capture an image of the screen and paste it
into your lab report. Cool? You ain't seen nothin' yet! </p>

<p>Suppose you want to "linearize" your data. Go on, suppose. For
example: you have a list of distances a toy car has gone down the ramp
and you have an equal number of time values associated with these
distances. You surmise from your first raw attempt to chart the data
(y~distance, x~time) that the curve is a quadratic. In order to
"linearize" the graph and get it to fit a model like: d=1/2 a t<sup>2</sup>
you need to develop a list of t<sup>2</sup> values. You
don't actually need to do this with this applet. Simply type x^2 in the
first box and the values will automatically be charted as the x
coordinate squared. Give it a try.

      <td>Consider this trivial example. Enter these values into
the x and y columns respectively. Type x in the first box under the
graph and y in the second. After you "plot" the data you should see a
typical quadratic. Notice that the line isn't a particularly good fit.
      <p>Now type x^2 in the first box. When you plot the data
now you should see a straight line.</p>
