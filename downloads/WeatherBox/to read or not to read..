WeatherBox v1.0 Build 10This is, after all, freeware.  I have now had a couple of reports of some minor bugs in the appelscript dictionary that have now been fixed.  Because it has been stable otherwise I am now issuing a release number.  One small consideration.  On PPC if you change the port in the setup dialog the applciation can be used immediately to connect to the Weather Monitor.  On 68k machines, however, it seems to be necessary to quit the program first and re-launch it before the change is recognized.  It appears as if this is short coming in the Communications Toolbox.  it is a minor inconvenience as the program always remembers the last setting.WeatherBox v0.9b4Weather Box should be considered beta at this time.  I have used it on a PM8500 (PPC) and a Centris 650 (68040) and will soon be trying it out on a new G3.   This is, after all, freeware.  I have found it to be very stable and reliable but I haven't the time or the money to test it on a wide variety of platforms.  I am fairly confident that it will behave well (at least not do any harm) on any Mac System meeting the following requirements:68040 machine or PPC.MacOS 8.1 or better.16Mb RAM or better.Appearance Manager is a plus but not essential.I am donating to the weather hobbist community in order to get some feedback for future releases.ThanksPaul BeekenKnowledge Software Consultinginfo@knowsoft.comhttp://www.knowsoft.com
