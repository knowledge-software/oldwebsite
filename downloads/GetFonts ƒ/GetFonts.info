There are actually 2 osaxen.  The first simply returns a list of installed fonts that are screen displayable.  (I intentionally ignore printer fonts.)  The second returns some simple information about the font.example:GetFonts-- returns a massive list of every font on your system (sans printer fonts)GetFontMetric "Palatino" size 18 style {italic, bold}--{ascent:12, descent:3, widMax:16, leading:1}Really, that is all there is to it.  The purpose is to get a list from which you can then present the user with.  GetFontMetric was easy so I threw it in to boot if you want to do some graphic processing.  I use it for exercises in AppleWorks. Here is the dictionary:System Object Suite: ©2000, Paul Beeken, Knowledge Software Consulting (pbbeeken@knowsoft.com)GetFonts: Get a list of all available fonts on this system.	GetFonts  anything	Result:   list  -- A list of the font names.GetFontMetric: Get the metrics of the named font.	GetFontMetric  string  -- name of font to get metrics about.		size  integer  -- point size for font information.  No entry means that the style is ‘plain’.		[style  Plain/Bold/Italic/Underline/Outline/Shadow/Condensed]  -- A style or list of styles to apply to this font.	Result:   FontMetric  -- A record of the font metrics.Class FontMetric: A record of font metricsProperties:	ascent  integer  -- The ascent or height above the baseline.	descent  integer  -- The descent or space below the baseline for this font.	widMax  integer  -- The width of the widest glyph for this font.	leading  integer  -- The leading or space below the descent for this font. (n.b. this isn’t the ‘printers’ leading, the true leading is the sum of the ascent, descent, and this value.)	font number  integer  [r/o]  -- The font number associated with this font.I have only tested it under MacOS 9.0  but there is no real reason it wont work back to Mac OS 8.1.  Remember, this is freeware, play nice.  Paul Beeken, Knowledge Software Consutlingknowsoft@idt.net
