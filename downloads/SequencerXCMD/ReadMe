              Sequencer xcmd  v 1.5©Paul B. Beeken, Ph.D. Knowledge Software Consulting  info@knowsoft.comThis is a simple XCMD for hypercard designed to access the Connectix QuickCAMª but it will control and capture from almost any QT compliant camera.  It uses the quicktime sequencer API to access the default sequencer.  It allows you to pop up a window which displays a preview of the output of the camera.  Optionally, you can specify the port, size, and style of the window.  It even snaps pictures!  Now  it has been tested with the color QuickCam and works with the built in video ports of the PM 8500 series.  Read on.The general syntax this command understands is:QuickCamSeq	open [, upperLeftLoc ][, full | half | quarter ]                                            [,printerPort | modemPort ][,' style' ][,dontFloat]          	 'style' can be one of the following:                    	pallete, plain, box, shadow, side, top                     where top is the default.  The order after the "open" command                     does not matter.the value returned is empty if there were no errorsThe command creates a window  which has the following properties over the standard set:	brightness   	0²b²100 contrast   	0²b²100 saturation   	0²b²100 sharpness   	0²b²100 hue   	0²b²100	port		  printerPort | modemPort  | portA | portB | portC  (Why  did I do this? who changes ports midstream?) filename    ClipBoard | full path name   sets a file or clipboard for pict saveThe window responds to the following messages:snap	           	- snaps the picture to clipboardpause		         - pauses the previewcontinue	     - starts the previewsettings       - opens the standard QT dialog for the video settings.The window's name is "©PaulBeeken,KnowSoft"  just in case you forget.Thank you for your support. This software is offered as is with no warranrtees expressed or implied.

As a software developer having experience in many plug-in API environments there are always subtle differences between supposed 'standard interfaces.'   Though this toy is an XCMD it is a "type 2" XCMD requiring the supporting application to provide for XWindow constructs.  As far as I know, only Hypercard and Authorware support these callbacks.  Director, FoxPro, Supercard and some others DO NOT support the xwindow  model.  They only work with the simple type 1 XCMDs.  changes since 1.1: fixed preview offset for digitizers whose active source rect is                                different than the destination rect.                               added color controls.changes since 1.0: modem / printer designator off by 1                                        added support for saving to file.
