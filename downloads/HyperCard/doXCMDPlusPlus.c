If you do not and you execute a method//	after A4 world has been altered, life ends.  //		i.e. an A4 world is created, an xcmd object is instantiated, the A4//		world is reset, then the destructor is called. If it is a //		virtual destructor (any time a virtual method is declared)//		all hell breaks loose after you return to the caller.//еееееееpascal void main( XCmdPtr	paramPtr ){	long	oldA4 = SetCurrentA4();	// A4 must be set up for globals, strings, and 									// inter-segment calls 	 	doXCMDPlusPlus ( paramPtr );	// <--- your code goes here			SetA4(oldA4);					// reset A4 before leaving XCMD}
